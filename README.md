## ChemRxivQuest

**ChemRxivQuest** is a curated, domain-specific dataset for natural language processing (NLP) in chemistry. It contains **970 high-quality questionâ€“answer (QA) pairs** extracted from **155 ChemRxiv preprints** spanning **17 subfields** of chemistry. Each QA pair is explicitly linked to its source text segment, ensuring scientific traceability and contextual accuracy.

---

### Project Highlights

* **Broad Coverage**: QA pairs span organic, inorganic, materials, physical chemistry, and more.
* **LLM-Generated QA**: Questions and answers generated using **GPT-4o** with structured prompts.
* **Rigorous Validation**: QA verified using **fuzzy matching** (â‰¥80% similarity threshold).
* **Structured for Use** in:
  * Retrieval-based QA systems
  * Fine-tuning chemistry-specific LLMs
  * Educational tools and semantic search

---

### Dataset Details

* **Total QA Pairs**: 970
* **Source**: ChemRxiv preprints (CC BY 4.0 license)
* **QA Types**:
  * Conceptual (23.7%)
  * Mechanistic (24.9%)
  * Applied (25.5%)
  * Experimental/Synthetic (25.7%)
* **Formats**: JSON, CSV
* **Preprint Metadata**: See `sources.tsv` for complete citation list of all 155 preprints.

### Getting Started

#### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mahmoud-amiri/ChemRxivQuest.git
cd ChemRxivQuest
pip install -r requirements.txt
````

---

### Example Use Cases

* Fine-tune LLMs on chemistry-specific Q\&A tasks
* Evaluate embeddings for semantic chemical retrieval (e.g., SciBERT, E5)
* Train RAG systems for chemistry
* Create educational tools or chemistry quiz generators

---

### Limitations

* Based on **preprints**, which may contain unverified or preliminary findings.
* Some QA pairs may include **hallucinations** from the LLM despite fuzzy matching validation.
* Domain imbalance â€” **Organic Chemistry** is overrepresented.

---

### Future Work

* Add **expert human validation** for improved quality
* Expand coverage to **peer-reviewed journals**
* Introduce **semantic verification with transformers**
* Release **leaderboards** for benchmarking QA models
