0	Sustainable and Efficient Extraction of Furfural from Bagasse: A Quantitative Analysis and Feasibility Study for Rural Economies	Muhammad Asif; Sana Sultan; Subhan Ishaq	Furfural, a valuable platform chemical produced from lignocellulosic biomass, has a wide range of commercial applications, including biofuels, polymers, and medicines. This study investigated the optimization of furfural extraction using sugarcane bagasse collected from sugar mills in Rahim Yar Khan, Pakistan. The findings showed that furfural yields ranged from 7.5% to 10%, with a particular sample yielding the maximum amount. Economic feasibility was also determined by calculating the costs of raw materials, labor, and equipment. This study suggests that sugarcane bagasse from the region offers a sustainable and cost-effective feedstock for furfural production, contributing to rural economic development while reducing the environmental impact through green chemical techniques.

1	Tailorable nanoparticles for magnetic water cleaning of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs)	Lukas Müller; Anna Zehetmeier; Anna Höfling; Henrik Gaß; Johannes Voß; Daniel Krappmann; Linda Rockmann; Elias Harrer; Dirk Zahn; Andreas Hirsch; Marcus Halik	Anthropogenic persistent organic pollutants pose a pressing threat to the environment and human health. They can be found in water bodies all around the world at low but hazardous concentrations. Typical representatives of this contaminant class are polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). Here, we present nanoparticulate core-shell water cleaning agents, which are able to remove PCBs of various chlorination degree from water. The core consists of superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles (SPIONs) providing large surface area that can be tuned via self-assembled monolayers (SAMs) composed of phosphonic acid derivates. This shell binds the pollutants non-covalently enabling facile magnetic water remediation. By employing positively charged or hydrophobic SAMs different PCBs can be preferentially removed. Furthermore, these orthogonal functionalities can be integrated in one SPION system. By combining charged and hydrophobic phosphonic acid derivates in so-called binary SAMs the removal preference can be convoluted, which works just as well in real river water. The cost-efficient availability of the base materials for these tailorable nanoparticles is complemented with recyclability laying the foundation for a sustainable water cleaning process.

2	Tailoring Phosphorene Quantum Dot via Electrochemical Methods for Enhanced Capacity Na-ion Batteries	Bikash Ranjan Isaac; Sankeerth Satish; S. Sreedeep; Sangram Mohapatra; Subbiah Alwarappan; Vijayamohan K. Pillai	The development of advanced energy storage technologies has driven significant interest in two-dimensional (2D) materials, particularly graphene, stanene, phosphorene and their analogues, due to their unique structural and electronic properties, as well as their propensity for doping. In this work, we demonstrate an electrochemical approach for tailoring phosphorene quantum dots (PQDs) specifically optimized for sodium-ion battery (SIB) applications using benchmark cathodes and electrolytes. Sodium-ion batteries, as a promising alternative to lithium-ion systems, benefit from the tunable surface area and conductivity provided by size-optimized PQDs, which enhance ion diffusion kinetics and charge storage capabilities. The size-tuning of PQDs is achieved through a controlled electrochemical exfoliation and passivation process, resulting in quantum dots with improved stability and a higher specific capacity. For example, the PQDs coupled with Prussian white analogue (PW) exhibit superior key performance metrics, showing a high discharge capacity of 250 mAg^-1 and capacity retention of 77% after 250 cycles, positioning them as a viable candidate for next-generation SIBs. This study presents a pathway for scalable production in SIBs using phosphorene-based materials, laying the groundwork for high-efficiency, sustainable energy storage solutions.

3	Tetracarboxylic aromatic acid-based self-healing metallosupramolecular flexible nano-scaffold: Exploring rheological features, stimuli-responsiveness and anti-bacterial efficiency	Biswajit Dey; Subhajoy Sadhu; Deblina Saha; Sai Jyoti Behera; Anupam Kundu; Ritu Ranjan Kumar; Suresh Kumar Yatirajula; Jnanendra Rath	Tetracarboxylic acid-directed formation strategy of Zn(II)-metallogel has been achieved through supramolecular interactions among gel-forming Zn(II) acetate dihydrate, pyromellitic acid and N,N'-dimethyl formamide (DMF). Role of pyromellitic acid as low molecular weight gelator in forming stable Zn(II)-metallogel has been established through the work. Mechanical stability of Zn(II)-metallogel has been characterized through several rheological analyses including frequency sweep, strain sweep, time sweep (i.e., thixotropic analysis), and Creep recovery tests. The morphological feature of the xerogel sample of Zn(II)-metallogel gets scrutinized through field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM) investigation. The elemental analyses associated to FESEM system has also been performed for getting the role of different metallogel-forming chemical ingredients. The stimuli-responsiveness of the prepared metallogel has been deciphered by applying several influences like mechanical shaking, sonication, heating effect, chemical factors like acid, base, UV-light exposure. The metallogel construction pathway has been explored through the employment of FT-IR and ESI-Mass spectral analyses. The biological effectiveness of the metallogel is also explored. Different kinds of bacteria including Gram +/− ve species such as Bacillus cereus (ATCC 13061), Listeria monocytogenes (MTCC 657), and Staphylococcus aureus (MTCC 96), Salmonella typhimurium (MTCC 98) and Escherichia coli (MTCC 1667) are subjected for exploring the bioactivity of synthesized Zn(II)-metallogel.

4	The 1.5 µm Band of Cyanoacetylene as a Spectroscopic Target in the Hunt for Prebiotic Molecules	Thomas Howard; Sanjana Maheshwari; Grace J. Yeh; Shannon E. Ganley; Leah G. Dodson	The search for prebiotic molecules officially entered a new era with the launch of the James Webb Space Telescope. The capabilities of the near-infrared instrumentation on board offer greater sensitivity and resolution than has ever been available in a space-based instrument. With the planned launch of more near-infrared telescopes—such as SPHEREx in 2025—it is essential to have laboratory data for important molecules on hand to guide observations in this spectral region. We present here the first published line list of the prebiotic cyanoacetylene (HC₃N) molecule in the 1.5µm region. Molecules were cooled to 20 K through the use of a cryogenic buffer-gas cooling yielding well-resolved ro-vibrational states of the 2ν₁ band that were probed and assigned using cavity-ringdown spectroscopy. Rotational constants were calculated using PGOPHER and spectral line intensities were measured relative to hydrogen cyanide. We recommend the HC₃N 1.5 µm band as an observational target for transmission spectroscopy at Hycan and Super-Earth exoplanetary bodies.

5	Towards a Global Model for Diabetic Kidney Disease Screening using ATR-FTIR	Víctor Navarro-Esteve; Ángel Sánchez-Illana; Jose Pórtoles; Maria Marques-Vidas; Josep Ventura-Gayete; Nuria Estañ Capell; Iris Viejo-Boyano; Francisco Valero-Mena; Antonio J. Sanchez-Lopez; Bayden R. Wood; David Pérez-Guaita	Infrared (IR) spectroscopy of urine extracts coupled with Machine Learning (ML) methods has been proposed as a promising technique for Diabetic Kidney Disease (DKD) screening. However, for clinical translation, predictive models based on machine learning techniques necessitate substantial sets of samples for calibration and testing under various experimental parameters and populations, posing a critical barrier to the development of globally deployable tools. Here, we aim to assess the methodology's ability to establish DKD diagnostic models applicable across diverse populations, instruments and experimental conditions worldwide. Two datasets were compared. The Australian set included 155 DKD and 22 control samples from a 24-hour urine collection, with preconcentrated proteins measured on a Bruker spectrometer. The Spanish set, comprising 35 DKD and 26 control spot urine samples, was analyzed using a Perkin-Elmer spectrometer. Different ML methods were developed to identify DKD and microalbuminuria, aiming to compare their performance in terms of generalization and adaptation to different datasets. Models developed using Australian spectra successfully predicted Spanish samples, achieving AUROC values of 0.87 and 0.98 for DKD and microalbuminuria identification, respectively. Both values improved to 0.99 when a global model was calibrated and independently tested with a combined set integrating samples from both countries. Results evidence that the spectral markers found in the IR spectra, based on signals arising from albumin and other glycoproteins, have proven to be robust, minimizing the effects of population and instrument variability. Results exemplify the potential of developing global big-data spectroscopic datasets to facilitate the deployment of IR-based diagnostic methods in real-world settings.

6	Towards carbon-free cathodes for fluoride ion batteries: deconvoluting effects of active material and conductive additive on charging and cyclic stability	Tommi Aalto; Roham Talei; Guido Schmitz; Oliver Clemens	In this study, conductive, fluorine and antimony co-doped tin oxide nanoparticles (FATO-NPs) are highlighted as a possible alternative for conductive carbon additives in fluoride ion batteries, successfully circumventing oxidative side reactions. Since good cyclability with high and stable discharge capacities was achieved with both types of conductive additive, it was concluded that conductive carbon is well suitable for high-voltage fluoride ion batteries, contrary to prior assumptions. The utilization of almost completely side-reaction free FATO-NPs as the conductive additive enables the deconvolution of other side reactions in initial cycles.

7	Tuning Magnetic Anisotropy and Luminescence Thermometry in a Series of Dysprosium Complexes containing β-diimine Ligand	Sukanya Bagchi; Sakshi Mehta; Sujit Kamilya; Mathieu Rouzières; Radovan Herchel; Mikhail Kiskin; Subrata Ghosh; Abhishake Mondal	Understanding spin dynamics in molecular systems is critical for developing advanced quantum materials, where optimizing structural parameters plays a pivotal role. Although significant progress has been made in studying the spin dynamics of β-diketone-Dysprosium(III) complexes with α-diimine bidentate ligands, the exploration of β-diimine-based ligands to elucidate the structure-property relationship in spin dynamics remains limited. Here, we report three Dysprosium complexes containing β-diimine based bidentate ligands, [Dy(dbm)3(bik-Et)] (1), [Dy(dbm)3(bik-Me)] (2), and [Dy(acac)3(bik-Et)] (3) (dbm = 1,3-diphenyl-1,3-propanedione, acac = acetylacetonate, bik-Et = bis(1-ethyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)methanone), and bik-Me = bis(1-methyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)methanone), which were synthesized and characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction analysis, spectroscopic, magnetic and theoretical investigations. Structural investigations showed a distorted square antiprism geometry in 1 and 3 and a trigonal bipyramidal geometry in 2 in a DyO6N2 environment. Magnetic studies reveal slow magnetic relaxation behaviour under a zero-applied DC field for all three complexes. Theoretical calculations at the DFT and CASSCF level of theory were carried out to find a better correlation between the electronic structure and magnetism of the reported complexes. Moreover, the variable temperature photoluminescence study of the complexes reveals these complexes performed significantly well in the application of luminescent thermometry.

8	Uncovering the Individual Hydrogen Bond Strengths and Cooperativity in Pure (H₂S)ₙ and Mixed (H₂O)ₘ(H₂S)ₙ (m + n = 2 to 8) Clusters	Deepak Patkar	The present investigation deals with the estimation individual hydrogen bond (HB) energy in pure (H₂S)ₙ (n = 3 to 8) and mixed (H₂O)ₘ(H₂S)ₙ (m + n = 2 to 8) clusters. A deeper understanding of individual interactions in these clusters are brought out in terms of energetics. Such a knowledge from the experimental studies is difficult. Therefore, the present investigation is important. The calculated results show that the hydrogen bonding strengths in these clusters range from 0.10 to 11.06 kcal mol⁻¹ at the MP2(full)/aug-cc-pVTZ level. The O-H…O HB being the strongest (0.10 to 11.06 kcal mol⁻¹), followed by O-H…S HB (1.36 to 6.89 kcal/mol), S-H…O HB (1.08 to 6.39 kcal mol⁻¹), and S-H…S HB (1.35 to 4.23 kcal mol⁻¹) being the weakest. The hydrogen bonding energies in dimers follow the same rank ordering, with lower energies due to the loss of cooperativity. Thus, cooperativity contributions in the hydrogen bonding range from 0.83 to 5.96 kcal mol⁻¹. The HB energies in pure (H₂S)ₙ clusters are similar but slightly smaller compared to those in mixed (H₂O)ₘ(H₂S)ₙ (m + n = 2 to 8) clusters. These results provide important insights into the structure and energetics of hydrogen bonding in pure and mixed clusters, and sheds light on the various interactions in chemical and biological systems. Such a profound knowledge of individual energetics is missing from the literature.	Physical Chemistry; Materials Chemistry	https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-gwdd6	CC BY 4.0

11	Development and Assessment of Boron, Cerium, and Silver Ternary-Doped Titanium Dioxide Photocatalysts for the UV-A Degradation of Ciprofloxacin Antibiotic	Yash Mishra; Dara Kiran; Hari Mahalingam	Due to the development of antimicrobial resistance, the continued presence of antibiotic residues in freshwater sources is a growing global concern and hence, it is necessary to degrade the antibiotics present in the polluted waters. In this study, three different boron, cerium, and silver ternary-doped TiO₂ photocatalysts with specific compositions were synthesized using the eco-friendly EDTA citrate method. The specific compositions investigated here are B₁Ce₀.₁Ag₀.₀₆TiO₂, B₁Ce₁Ag₀.₁₆TiO₂, and B₁Ce₁Ag₀.₁₀TiO₂. From DLS analysis, the particle size of the synthesized catalysts was found to be in the range of 125 – 500 nm. The XRD spectra confirmed the presence of cerium. The DRS analysis showed the bandgap energy of the synthesized catalysts to be in the range of 2.7 – 2.8 eV. ICP-OES analysis was done to check the leaching of the dopants from the catalysts into the solution and the results showed that silver did not leach out while boron (~0.2 ppm) and cerium (~0.1 ppm) were present in trace amounts. The catalysts were also evaluated for the degradation of ciprofloxacin antibiotic under UV-A light. At optimized conditions, the best performing photocatalyst namely, B₁Ce₁Ag₀.₁TiO₂ showed ~54% degradation of the antibiotic in 120 min. This is attributed to the increased amounts of cerium and silver. Although the performance under UV-A irradiation is not encouraging, these results suggest that these catalysts may be more effective under visible or solar light and further work is needed to check the effectiveness under visible light irradiation as well as on larger scales of treatment.

12	Development and characterization of the first selective class IIb histone deacetylase degraders	Shiyang Zhai; Irina Honin; Linda Schäker-Hübner; Maria Hanl; Lukas Jacobi; Finn Dressler; Dominika Ewa Pieńkowska; Philipp König; Jan Gerhardt; Rabea Vogel; Gerd Bendas; Michael Gütschow; Felix Meissner; Bjoern B. Burckhardt; Radosław P. Nowak; Christian Steinebach; Finn K. Hansen	Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are emerging new therapeutic modalities that facilitate the targeted degradation of disease-relevant proteins via an event-driven mode of action. In this work, we report the design, synthesis, and biological evaluation of the first-in-class selective degraders of the class IIb histone deacetylases (HDACs) 6 and 10. To this end, the dual HDAC6/10 inhibitor tubastatin A and a ring-opened analog were connected via well-established PROTAC linkers to pomalidomide and phenylglutarimides as cereblon recruiters. This approach led to the discovery of AP1 (HDAC6 DC50 = 13 nM; HDAC10 DC50 = 29 nM) as a potent degrader of class IIb HDACs. Importantly, AP1 neither degraded HDAC1/8 (class I) and HDAC4/7 (class IIa), nor induced histone H3 hyperacetylation, thereby confirming its selectivity for class IIb HDACs. Due to its low cytotoxicity against hematological and solid cancer cell lines, AP1 represents a valuable tool compound for the chemical knockdown of class IIb HDACs.

13	Development of Repetitive Synergism in Calotropis procera Extract with Ampicillin for Combating Drug Resistance in Clinical Bacteria and Identification of its Bioactive Components using GS-MS Analysis	Mathew Gideon; Zakari Ladan; Yahaya Yakubu	The pursuit of innovative approaches to develop lead compounds that exhibit selectivity, efficacy, and safety as potential candidates for clinical trials poses a significant scientific challenge. Natural products, with their inherent diversity, offer unique pharmacophores, chemotypes, and scaffolds that can be harnessed to create effective drugs targeting various infections and diseases. This study introduces a straightforward, rudimentary, and environmentally sustainable method to enhance the antimicrobial activity of two less potent antimicrobial agents, fostering consistent and repetitive synergism against drug-resistant clinical bacteria. Utilizing gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) analysis, the study identified 53 phytochemicals in the extract, with oleic acid, 1,1,3,5,7,7,7-nonamethyl-3-(trimethylsiloxy) tetrasiloxane, 9-heptadecanone, cystamine, and tetrahydro-4H-pyran-4-ol emerging as the top five most abundant phytochemicals. The study's findings underscore the potential of medicinal plant phytochemicals in synthetic combination reactions, either with themselves or other drugs/agents, to yield a diverse array of compounds exhibiting significant pharmacological activities.

14	Development of simplified, photo-active, and Tfr1-targeted poly(β-aminoester)-zwitterion nanovehicles for gene delivery across brain endothelium	Maria C Lucana; Shambhavi Pandey; Salvador Borrós; Benjamí Oller-Salvia	Although nucleotide-based therapeutics hold promise for a variety of diseases, their clinical application is limited because of low stability and poor bioavailability. Among non-viral gene delivery vectors, poly(β-aminoester)s (pBAEs) stand out because of their low cytotoxicity, high transfection capacity, and adequate biodegradation profile. Oligopeptide end-Modified pBAEs (OM-pBAEs) enable enhanced polynucleotide encapsulation, cellular internalization, and transfection. Despite the outstanding properties of OM-pBAEs as non-viral gene delivery vectors, traditional OM-pBAE formulations have low cell selectivity and require formulation with two or more polymers. In this study, we first develop a simplified OM-pBAE formulation with a single polymer (pBAE-CRHR) and then add a zwitterionic moiety as part of the end-capping process (pBAE-CRHR-Zw). Subsequently, we show that addition of a photo-cleavable moiety enabled selective recovery of transfection capacity. Finally, we functionalize pBAE-CRHR-Zw with BrainBike-4, a bicyclic peptidomimetic binding transferrin receptor 1, and show that the targeted polyplexes display improved capacity to transfect cells with high levels of Tfr1 and to transmigrate in a human cell-based model of the BBB.

15	Discrete Element Method Model of An Extrusion Process with Recirculation for Dry Manufacturing of Lithium-Ion Battery Electrodes	Pei Sun; Paul Vigneaux; Alejandro A. Franco	In this article, we report a computational modeling study to enhance the understanding of the solvent-free extrusion process employed to produce filaments for the 3D printing of lithium-ion battery electrodes. Our study is supported by a newly developed dynamic 3D-resolved numerical model capable of simulating the extrusion process, including material recirculation within the extruder. This model describes the extrusion process at the mesoscale through a granular approach based on the discrete element method. Our model accounts for the main features of the twin-screw extruder, allowing the simulation of several recirculation cycles and extrusion of active material, carbon additive, and binder mixtures. We discuss how different electrode material formulations, material injection sequences, twin-screw rotation speeds, and residence time in the extruder barrel affect the microstructure and particle distribution of the extruded filament. Finally, we calculate parameters including the porosity, tortuosity factor, effective diffusivity and electrical conductivity of the filament microstructures.

16	Dispersion energy from the time-independent coupled-clusters polarization propagator	Piotr S. Żuchowski; Robert Moszynski	We present a new method of calculation of the dispersion energy in the second-order symmetry-adapted perturbation theory. Using the Longuet-Higgins integral and time-independent coupled-cluster response theory one shows that the general expression for the dispersion energy can be written in terms of cluster amplitudes and the excitation operators $\sigma$, which can be obtained by solving a linear equation. We introduced an approximate scheme dubbed CCPP2(T) for the dispersion energy accurate to the second order of intramonomer correlation, which includes certain classes to be summed to infinity. Assessment of the accuracy of the CCPP2(T) dispersion energy against the FCI dispersion for He$_2$ demonstrates its high accuracy. For more complex systems CCPP2(T) matches the accuracy of the best methods introduced for calculations of dispersion so far. The method can be extended to higher-order levels of excitations, providing a systematically improvable theory of dispersion interaction.

18	Dynamic Sorption and Interfacial Assembly of Polysaccharide on Hydrophobic v. Hydrophilic Surfaces	Behrooz Azimzadeh; Carmen Enid Martinez	The molecular structure and wettability of a surface plays a major role in dissolved organic matter (DOM) adsorption-desorption dynamics at water/solid interfaces. We studied the retention dynamics of a model DOM (i.e., a polysaccharide) at the water/diamond and water/goethite interface. In-situ adsorption-desorption experiments were conducted to probe the interfacial dynamicity of sorbed polysaccharide (PS) and its impact on surface wettability. Experiments revealed distinct bonding and kinetic behavior that depended on the polarity of the surface: goethite presented a higher adsorption capacity and binding strength but slower adsorption kinetics, compared to the diamond. Further, 2D correlation IR spectroscopy demonstrated surface polarity, surface loading and time alter the polysaccharide’s conformation and self-assembly during adsorption and desorption. On goethite, electrostatic interactions with the surface were followed by the formation of inter- and intra- molecular H-bonds between side groups of polysaccharide chains, while at greater PS loading hydrophobic interactions between PS groups became predominant. In contrast, the non-polar diamond surface promoted hydrophobic interactions that governed polysaccharide retention initially; subsequently, increased PS loading promoted H-bond formation between its charged hydrophilic groups. Both PS-goethite and PS-diamond organo-mineral associations developed a hydrophobic character (i.e., low wettability) upon PS adsorption. Thus, we posit the stronger retention of nonpolar organic pollutants observed in soils might be caused, at least in part, by pollutant-organic interactions within hydrophobic pockets in organo-mineral associations. This work helps us understand and predict interactions of importance to environmental and engineering systems such as the retention and transport of polar and nonpolar solutes in porous media.

19	Effects of Surface Chemistry on the Mechanochemical Decomposition of Lubricant Additives	Egheosa Ogbomo; Fakhru H. Bhuiyan; Carlos Ayestarán Latorre; Ashlie Martini; James P. Ewen	The growth of protective tribofilms from lubricant antiwear additives on rubbing surfaces is initiated by mechanochemical decomposition reactions. These processes are not well understood at the molecular scale for many important additives, such as tricresyl phosphate (TCP). One aspect that needs further clarification is the extent to which the surface properties affect the mechanochemical decomposition rate. In this study, we use nonequilibrium molecular dynamics (NEMD) simulations with a reactive force field (ReaxFF) to study the decomposition of TCP molecules confined and pressurised between sliding ferrous surfaces at a range of temperatures. We compare the decomposition of TCP on native iron, iron carbide, and iron oxide surfaces. We show that the decomposition rate of TCP molecules increases exponentially with temperature and shear stress, implying that this is a stress-augmented thermally activated process. The rates and products of decomposition depend on the properties of the confining surfaces. The activation energy, activation volume, and pre-exponential factor are similar for TCP decomposition between iron and iron carbide surfaces, but significantly different for iron oxide surfaces. These findings provide new insights into the mechanochemical decomposition of TCP and have important implications for the design of novel lubricant additives for use in high-temperature and high-pressure environments.

20	Efficient Ethane Production via SnCl₄ Lewis Acid-Enhanced CO₂ Electroreduction in a Flow Cell Electrolyser	Sankeerthana Bellamkonda; Ian Brewis; Venkateswar Rao Gedela; Rana Faisal Shahzad; Mohamed Mamlouk; Shahid Rasul	The development of efficient and selective catalysts for electrochemical CO₂ reduction (CO₂RR) is critical for advancing sustainable energy solutions. Here, we report a unique catalyst system based on SnCl₄ Lewis acid-modified Cu₂O, demonstrating enhanced performance in CO₂ electroreduction to ethane. The SnCl₄ modification introduces chloride ions directly onto the Cu₂O surface, creating a synergistic interaction between Sn, Cl, and Cu active sites that optimizes the electronic environment for CO₂RR. The catalyst was coated onto a gas diffusion electrode (GDE) and tested in a flow cell electrolyser, with a Fumasep bipolar membrane and a platinum (Pt) foil as the anode. This system achieved a peak Faradaic efficiency of 34.8% for ethane production at -1.0 V vs. RHE, along with 11.3% efficiency for ethylene. Electrochemical studies revealed that the SnCl₄-modified Cu₂O exhibits low charge transfer resistance and high stability during prolonged electrolysis, with total current densities reaching 74.8 mA cm⁻² with a Tafel slope of 92.3 mV/dec at 0.4 V overpotential. Mechanistic investigations, supported by density functional theory, Raman, XRD, and electrochemical Impedance spectroscopy analyses, highlight the critical role of chloride ions in stabilizing CO intermediates and facilitating C-C bond formation, essential for C₂ product generation. Operating in a flow cell configuration, the system demonstrated high energy efficiency and selectivity, establishing the SnCl₄-modified Cu₂O (CTC) as a promising catalyst for CO₂RR. These findings offer a scalable and economically viable pathway for renewable hydrocarbon production, paving the way for practical applications in carbon-neutral energy cycles.

21	Efficient Hydrogen Production on Crystalline-Amorphous Heterostructured Cobalt Boride-Phosphite Electrocatalyst	Jean Marie Vianney Nsanzimana; Charles Otieno Ogolla; Nastaran Farahbakhsh; Yilmaz Sakalli; Marco Hepp; Jonas Frohne; Walter Sebastian Scheld; Manuela S. Killian; Benjamin Butz	Targeted phase engineering of nanomaterials through non-equilibrium synthesis strategies provides a rich platform for the development and tuning of nanostructured catalysts with outstanding properties and life-time. Unconventional phases or even complex heterostructures play a crucial role in the performance of catalysts for efficient water electrolysis. By utilizing a controlled, iterative reduction synthesis route, a tailored binder-free cobalt boride-phosphite electrode (CoₓB-[0.2]P-O) with mixed crystalline-amorphous phases is developed. The tailored cobalt chemistry, hierarchical morphology and mixed phases synergistically enhance the catalytic activity for hydrogen evolution reaction (HER). Those electrodes exhibit platinum-like HER performance with an overpotential of 33 mV at the standard current density of 10 mA cm⁻², with excellent intrinsic kinetics and enhanced electron transfer in an alkaline 1M KOH electrolyte. Comprehensive microstructure and spectroscopic analyses proved the success of the one-pot strategy to modulate the chemistry of cobalt by incorporating boron and phosphite. Moreover, the tailored formation of nanostructures with locally varying morphology by the co-existence of amorphous and crystalline phases on the nanometer scale is confirmed. This approach facilitates the rational design for tuning the metal boride-based catalysts’ activity for hydrogen evolution by tailored chemistry of the metal active centers and thus the phase engineering of similar nanomaterials while avoiding the necessity of any post-synthesis thermal treatment processes.

22	Electrocatalytic Oxidative Hydrofunctionalization Reactions of Alkenes via Co(II/III/IV) Cycle	Fan Yang; Yi-Chen Nie; Han-Yuan Liu; Lei Zhang; Fanyang Mo; Rong Zhu	Here we disclose a general and versatile Co(II/III/IV) electrocatalytic platform for alkene functionalization. Driven by electricity, a set of the oxidative hydrofunctionalization reactions initiated by hydrogen atom transfer were demonstrated without the need for stochiometric chemical oxidants. The scope of the reactions encompasses hydroalkoxylation, hydroacyloxylation, hydroarylation, semi-pinacol rearrangement, and deallylation. Mechanistic studies and stereochemical evidence support an ECEC process involving an electrochemically-generated organocobalt(IV) intermediate. This work presents an example of reactivity space expansion in electrocatalysis of VB12-systems by going beyond the common oxidation states of Co(I/II/III). Using electric current as a traceless reagent in transition metal catalysis has opened up a new avenue for the development of sustainable transformations. Transition metal complexes can serve as electron transfer mediators to reduce overpotentials, and meanwhile bring in rich and tunable reactivities for electrosynthesis.

Here, explicit instruction and fuel cell engineering are used to exemplify electrochemical science as a platform for teaching a variety of interdisciplinary concepts while addressing common misconceptions related to potentials.

Sreedee; Sankeerth Satish; Subbiah Alwarappan; Vijayamohan K. Pillai	Quantum Dots have received extensive attention recently, paving the way for exploring their utility due to their intriguing size-dependent properties, solubility manipulation, and susceptibility to surface modification/doping. Among all types of quantum dots, Stanene is a topological insulator exhibiting enhanced spin-orbit coupling, making it a promising zero-dimensional material with augmented optical and electrical properties. Given these exceptional characteristics, the development of efficient methods to synthesize Stanene quantum dots with precise size distribution is of significant interest. We report the electrochemical transformation of Tin powder to carbon-coated stanene quantum dots at room temperature in a non-aqueous media. Ultraviolet-visible and photoluminescence spectroscopy results confirm the size-dependent properties of stanene quantum dots. Transmission electron micrographs, powder X-ray diffraction, and Fourier transform infrared analysis further supplement the size-dependent properties of these quantum dots, which are potential candidates for applications in catalysis, sensors, energy storage and medical imaging. For example, a Li-ion battery fabricated using the anode reveals a stable capacity of 260 mAh g^-1 consistently after coupling with a standard cathode like lithium in an electrolyte of LiPF6 in ethylene carbonate (EC) and dimethyl carbonate (DMC).

25	Electronic complexity of active site models for FeNC catalysts: a systematic study of truncation effects in molecular and periodic models	Charlotte Gallenkamp; Young-Joon Song; Niklas von Rhein; Genís Lleopard Motis; Roser Valentí; Vera Krewald	Single-atom FeNC catalysts are promising for small molecule activation reactions, but the structures and electronic details of their active sites are not well understood. This study investigates the optimal model size for computational studies of FeNC catalysts using FeN₄C₁₀ and FeN₄C₁₂ active site models. The electronic complexity of these models, including spin configurations, redox events, and unpaired electrons, is explored. The study highlights the need for axial displacements or ligand binding to stabilize high spin configurations, impacting the interpretation of experimental data and the mechanism of the oxygen reduction reaction.

26	Elucidating Pt/C and ionomer aggregation dynamics in the manufacturing of Fuel Cell catalyst layers: a discrete element method approach	Sourab Barath Vijayaraghavan; Matthias Baldofski; Alejandro A. Franco	The production of fuel cells is bottle-necked by the prohibitive cost of one component – the catalyst layer. The goal of manufacturers has been to minimise Pt loading and maximise the electrochemical efficiency, at scale. A mesoscale model is sought-after, to describe the influence of common manufacturing parameters on the microstructure of fuel cell catalyst layers. In this work we propose a novel end-to-end mesoscale modeling workflow to capture the spatial aggregation of carbon support particles against an ionomer-based binder. We use the Discrete Element Method (DEM) to capture the co-aggregation of the carbon-support and binder, as a function of their inter-particle Derjaguin–Landau–Verwey–Overbeek (DLVO) interactions. This model provides insights in the variance in ionomer aggregation as a function of solvent composition. We observe a decrease in ionomer secondary aggregation with decreasing water content. This variance in the local catalyst – ionomer distribution was studied using various micro-structural descriptors.

27	Engineering antisense oligonucleotides for targeted mRNA degradation through lysosomal trafficking	Disha Kashyap; Thomas A. Milne; Michael J. Booth	Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) can modulate gene expression at the mRNA level, providing the ability to tackle conventionally undruggable targets and usher in an era of personalized medicine. A key mode of action for ASOs relies upon RNase H-engagement in the nucleus, however, the site for mature mRNA is the cytoplasm. This disconnect limits the efficacy and biomedical applications of ASOs. In this paper, we have established a new mechanism of action for achieving potent and targeted mRNA knockdown by leveraging a lysosomal degradation pathway. To achieve this, we employ autophagosome-tethering compound (ATTEC) technology that utilises bifunctional small molecules for lysosomal trafficking. In this manner, to achieve degradation of target mRNA located in the cytoplasm, we conjugated an ATTEC warhead, ispinesib, to RNase H-inactive ASOs. These fully 2′-O-Methylated RNase H-inactive ASOs have higher chemical stability and tighter mRNA binding than conventional ‘gapmer’ sequences, but cannot be recognised by RNase H. Our RNase H-inactive ASO-ispinesib conjugates produced a higher degree of knockdown than even state-of-the-art RNase H-active ‘gapmer’ ASOs. Using lysosomal trafficking antisense oligonucleotide (LyTON) technology, we knock down Menin (MEN1), a promising clinical target in leukemias. Engineered to degrade mRNA independent of RNase H recognition, LyTONs will enable gene silencing using oligonucleotide chemistries with higher chemical stability, tighter mRNA binding affinity, and improved cell delivery profiles. This will enable us to target a wider range of disease-relevant mRNA, potentially leading to the development of new therapies.

28	Evolution of Shape Anisotropy in Iron Oxides Nanocrystals under Biogenic Ligand Field and Photocatalytic Efficiency under Tropical Sunlight	Lahur Mani Verma; Aejaz Ul Bashir; Pravin P. Ingole; Satyawati Sharma	The continued interest in one of the ancient, well-known and earth-abundant materials, iron oxide, has been due to its fascinating magnetic, optical and redox properties. This perhaps allowed its intricate connection to the history of life on Earth. The recent spurt of interest in the properties of sustainable materials with reduced dimensions has put iron oxides again into intensive exploration for its catalytic, redox, and photoelectrochemical applications. However, the origin of the shape anisotropy in iron oxide nanocrystals and its functional link with the geochemical and photocatalytic processes remain unaddressed. We, in this work, attempted to understand their shape anisotropy induced by naturally relevant organic ligands from sugar press mud (PM) under the framework of non-classical crystallisation theory (NCCT). We further followed its emergent but dramatic behaviour during photocatalysis using an electro-analytical approach. We found in our experiment that the evolution of shape anisotropy (spheres to sheets and rods) in iron oxide nanocrystals (~24-44 nm) remains explainable using NCCT, even in the case of the PM ligands as an additive to the reaction solution. However, the differences in their photocatalytic abilities (rate constants 'k', 0.14-0.34 min^-1) could be better explained using the concept of electrochemical work function (ϕ_ad^0), and electrochemically active surface area (ESCA) than merely relying on band gap (E_g) and charge (e-/h+) carrier dynamics. Moreover, the findings of this work may inform the understanding of the fundamental mineralisation process in nature as well as the rationale design of a sustainable photo-catalyst.

30	Expanding metal catalyzed arene C–H borylation beyond boronate esters	Milan Kumar Bisai; Justyna Łosiewicz; Gary S. Nichol; Andrew P. Dominey; Stephen P. Thomas; Stuart A. Macgregor; Michael J. Ingleson	The metal-catalyzed intermolecular C–H borylation of arenes is an extremely powerful C–H functionalization methodology. However, to date it is effectively restricted to forming organo-boronate esters (Aryl–B(OR)_2) with its application to form other organoboranes rarely explored. Herein, we report a catalytic intermolecular arene C–H borylation method using the commercial and inexpensive hydroborane 9-borabicyclo-[3.3.1]-nonane, (H–BBN)_2. This process is effective for mono- and di-borylation to form a range of Aryl–BBN compounds using either NacNacAl or NacNacZn ((NacNac={(2,6-Pr_2C_6H_3)N(CH_3)C}_2CH) based catalysts. The crude Aryl–BBN products can be used in-situ for subsequent transformations, including an example that does not proceed using the analogous pinacol-boronate ester. Mechanistic studies indicated an unusual σ-bond metathesis process between NacNacZn–Aryl and the hydroborane, with first order kinetics in the hydroborane dimer ((H–BBN)_2). Our proposed calculated metathesis pathway involves ligand non-innocence and addition of both H–BBN units in (H–BBN)_2 to the NacNacZn–Aryl complex. This is in contrast to the conventional σ-bond metathesis mechanism using hydroboranes which invariably proceeds by reaction of one equivalent of a monomeric hydroborane with a M–C unit. Overall, this work demonstrates the utility of extending catalytic arene C–H borylation beyond the boronate esters that currently dominate this field, while highlighting that the σ-bond metathesis reaction can be mechanistically more complex when utilizing dimeric hydroboranes.

32	Machine learning-guided materials and system co-design for high-pressure hydrogen compression	Matthew D. Witman; Brendan Davis; Vitalie Stavila; Terry Johnson	Cost effective and reliable hydrogen compression remains a challenging barrier in the wide-spread adoption of hydrogen as an energy carrier. The prevailing technology of mechanical compression suffers from several drawbacks, some of which can be addressed by non-mechanical compression strategies (e.g., electrochemical or metal hydride-based thermal compression). Thermally driven metal hydride compression strategies typically rely on multi-stage metal hydride-based compressors; however, discovering or optimizing low-stability metal hydrides that can pressurize hydrogen upwards of 1000 bar is difficult, both with respect to computational predictions and experimental validation. Here we (1) demonstrate that simple machine learning-derived design rules can inform rational design of alloying strategies yielding low-stability hydrides, (2) validate their experimental pressure-composition-temperature (PCT) isotherms up to 875 bar, and (3) utilize a dynamic systems-level model of a metal hydride compressor design to evaluate their performance under realistic operating conditions. Importantly, this analysis yields predicted operational efficiencies of both 2-stage (90-875 bar) and 3-stage (20-875 bar) metal hydride compressors to enable further evaluation of this technology and its techno-economic outlook.

33	Magnetic sponge like behavior in a heterobimetallic cyanide bridged 1D ladder chain	Mayurika Das; Sujit Kamilya; Sakshi Mehta; Radovan Herchel; Abhishake Mondal	A two-dimensional coordination complex {[Mn(Me-im)₃(H₂O)][Cr(CN)₆]0.5[Mn(EtOH)₂]} (1) (Me-im= 1-Methylimidazole) has been synthesized by following the “building-block” strategy from the reaction between [Cr(CN)₆]³⁻ and Mn(II) with monodentate 1-methylimidazole ligand. The complex was characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, magnetic, gas adsorption and spectroscopic studies. Crystal structure analyses reveal that in the 2D network is formed, the central Cr is linked to two Mn centers of different coordination environments in the [CrMn₂] asymmetric unit by Cr₃⁺-CN-Mn₂⁻ bridges. Extension of the 2D network forms “1D ladder like chains” of finite width. N₂ gas adsorption studies on desolvated sample reveals a Type II adsorption isotherm at 77 K. Magnetic studies of 1 reveal strong ferrimagnetic ordering with T_C = 2.15 K. In an attempt to increase the ordering temperature, the magnetic sponge property has also been investigated for this system by successive desolvation and resolvation, and likewise an increase in the ordering temperature has been observed.

34	Magneto-Plasmonics-Enhanced Colorimetric Lateral Flow Immunoassay Using Magnetic-Gold Nanostars	Supriya Atta; Taylor L. Thorsen; Yuanhao Zhao; Sebastian Sanchez; Haydon J. Hill; Vanessa K. Berner; Marcellene A. Gates-Hollingsworth; Jasmine Pramila Devadhasan; Alexander Jarrett Summers; Jian Gu; Douglas C. Montgomery; David P. AuCoin; Frederic Zenhausern; Tuan Vo-Dinh	Colorimetric lateral flow immunoassays (LFIA) have revolutionized point-of-care testing (POCT) methods by providing simple, rapid, accessible, and instrumentation-free detection of infectious diseases. However, conventional LFIAs relying on gold nanospheres (GNPs) can suffer from limited sensitivity due to weak colorimetric signal intensity at the test line, restricting their diagnostic potential. To overcome this limitation, we developed a magneto-plasmonics enhanced colorimetric LFIA (mpLFIA)- a breakthrough platform that integrates a novel hybrid nanoparticle system-magnetic gold nanostars (mpGNS). By leveraging dual enhancement mechanisms - magnetic preconcentration and plasmonic amplification through the gold nanostar shell coating of the magnetic core- the mpLFIA achieves unprecedented signal intensity and detection performance. Among the tested mpGNS variants, mpGNS-3- distinguished by its longest spikes and highest branch density- emerged as the most effective colorimetric signal amplifier when evaluated using Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) nucleoprotein as a model analyte. Our mpLFIA platform achieves an outstanding limit of detection (LOD) of 2.24 pg/mL for RVFV nucleoprotein in 1X PBS buffer, demonstrating a 1000-fold enhancement over conventional GNP-based assays. Our prototype mpLFIA platform, utilizing highly spiked mpGNS-3, exhibits great potential as a powerful bioanalytical tool, combining high sensitivity with practical portability for point-of-care applications.

35	Material Characterization of NMC Black Mass from End-of-Life Lithium-Ion Batteries for Enhanced Recycling Strategies	Hammad Farooq; Sulalit Bandyopadhyay	Recycling black mass (BM) obtained from NMC-based end-of-life lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) is hindered by metallic impurities (Al and Cu), residual electrolytes, and PVDF (polyvinylidene fluoride) binder. Pre-treatment of BM, such as milling and pyrolysis, to remove these impurities necessitates characterizing its physicochemical properties that affect such pre-treatment methods. More importantly, a judicious combination of characterization techniques can provide an integrated framework for efficiently planning pre-treatment and recycling processes. In this study, industrial BM samples from end-of-life NMC622, NMC111, and NMC901 LIBs are characterized. The comparative characterization of BM using FBRM (focused beam reflectance measurement) and laser diffraction techniques showed that applying square weighting to the chord length distribution measured by FBRM yields values close to the actual particle size, while also providing a method that can be used for real-time analysis of recycling processes. XRD (x-ray diffraction), complemented by SEM (scanning electron microscopy) and metal composition data confirmed that crystalline NMC phases remain intact in untreated BM and graphite exists as a mixture of 2H and 3R phases. Additionally, Raman spectroscopy with SEM elemental analysis provided insights into the carbonaceous deposits and metal particles on graphite surfaces. Qualitative TGA/MS (thermogravimetry with mass spectrometry) of BM under pyrolytic conditions allowed the identification of residual electrolytes and PVDF through the evolution of carbonaceous and fluorinated gases. Quantitative TGA/MS under oxidative conditions allowed quantification of total carbon in BM and estimation of PVDF. Explored characterization techniques highlight the impact of pre-treatment processes and provide a decision framework for selecting and optimizing recycling strategies.

Franco	Laboratory practices are essential to prepare students and professionals to drive future innovations in the field of energy storage and conversion. However, universities and industries working in the battery field encounter challenges such as effective and efficient training on complex concepts related to battery production, mostly due to the lack of access to battery prototyping facilities or the limited availability of battery manufacturing pilot lines for training purposes. This Concept introduces an innovative educational platform in Virtual Reality (VR) named Battery Manufacturing Metaverse (BMM). BMM promotes accessibility, inclusion and collaborative learning of Lithium Ion Battery (LIB) manufacturing through an interactive and flexible VR representation of a LIB manufacturing pilot line. It enables collaboration among students and researchers from different geographical locations. Users can explore electrode and cell chemistries and adjust manufacturing parameters with informative feedback from a cell’s composition to the functioning of the manufacturing equipment. BMM does it with real-time collaboration using avatars and voice chat. This platform aims to connect universities of i-MESC (Interdisciplinarity in Materials for Energy Storage and Conversion, previously MESC+), an Erasmus+ MSc. Program, enabling seamless knowledge sharing and training. BMM represents a transformative step in battery research and education, offering an immersive, interactive environment without geographical barriers to pave the way towards global education and safe training in the energy sector.

37	Microenvironment effects from first principles multiscale modeling of electrochemical CO2 reduction	F. Lorenzutti; R.R. Seemakurthi; E.F. Johnson; S. Morandi; P. Nikačević; N. López; S. Haussener	Electrochemical CO₂ reduction will be a key player in net-zero technologies, yet its industrial implementation is limited. Improvements by fine-tuning the microenvironments, electrolyte environments around the catalytic sites, have been scarce due to the interplay between electrode kinetics and transport. Here, we couple atomistic insights with continuum transport via ab-initio multiscale modeling, explicitly including electrolyte effects at all scales. The model was validated on Ag planar electrodes in several liquid electrolytes and the current dependence with voltage aligns with experimental observations. We show that a balance between CO₂ diffusion and cation accumulation needs be achieved to obtain optimal rates. In ionomers, this limitation can be overcome since organic cations-based microenvironments are present at a fixed concentration, but water management becomes critical. Our approach paves the way towards rational microenvironment design in electrochemical CO₂ conversion.

39	Molecular orientation and stratification revealed in RNA-lipid nanoparticles using Cryogenic Orbitrap Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (Cryo-OrbiSIMS) depth profiling	Anna M Kotowska; Michael Fay; Julie A Watts; Ian Gilmore; David J. Scurr; Alaina Howe; Vladimir Capka; Corey Perez; Devin Doud; Siddharth Patel; Mark Umbarger; Robert Langer; Morgan R Alexander	Lipid nanoparticle RNA (LNP-RNA) formulations are used for the delivery of vaccines and other therapies. RNA molecules are encapsulated within their interior through electrostatic interactions with positively charged lipids. The identity of the lipids that present at their surface play a role in how they interact with and are perceived by the body and their resultant potency. Here, we use a model formulation to develop cryogenic sample preparation for molecular depth profiling Orbitrap secondary ion mass spectrometry (Cryo-OrbiSIMS) preceded by morphological characterisation using cryogenic transmission electron microscopy (Cryo-TEM). It is found that the depth distribution of individual lipid components is revealed relative to the surface and the RNA cargo defining the core. A preferential lipid orientation can be determined for the 1,2-Dimyristoyl-glycero-3-methoxypolyethylene glycol 2000 (DMG-PEG2k) molecule, by comparing the profiles of PEG to DMG fragments. PEG fragments are found immediately during analysis of the LNP surface, while the DMG fragments are deeper, coincident with RNA ions located in the core, in agreement with established models of LNPs. This laboratory-based de novo analysis technique requires no labelling, providing advantages over large facility neutron scattering characterisation.

40	Nitrogen Abundant Hexaazatriphenylene-diaminobenzidine Covalent Organic Framework as Promising Cathode Material in Lithium-ion Battery	Korak Kar; Sabiar Rahaman; Yuchen Liu; Krishna D. Bhalerao; Hiran Jyothila; Benjamin Duff; M. Dinachandra Singh; Basker Sundararaju; Kumar Biradha; Ashok Keerthi	In recent years, covalent organic frameworks (COFs) have emerged as promising materials because of their porosity, crystallinity, tunability and composition of lightweight elements. Conventionally, COFs have been mostly synthesized by reversible reactions to impart crystallinity. However, irreversible aromatic nucleophilic substitution reactions can lead to more stable materials which are much more relevant to electrochemical applications. Embedding nitrogen atoms in the rigid carbon framework in the form of phenazine and secondary arylamine moieties provides redox-active sites to the material which has been shown to provide impressive performance as cathode material in lithium-ion batteries. Herein, we report a nitrogen-rich, hexaazatriphenylene-diaminobenzidine based COF through -C-N-linkages synthesized via irreversible aromatic nucleophilic reactions. Due to its diverse structural features, our COF serves as a highly viable electrode material, demonstrating excellent stability and recyclability in Li-ion batteries. Our COF achieves an impressive capacity of 265 mAh/g at a current density of 0.02 A/g, with a remarkable energy density of 607 Wh/kg. Furthermore, it retains a high Coulombic efficiency of ~98% throughout the charge-discharge process even after several hundred cycles.

Killan	The outcome of an implant procedure largely depends on the implant’s surface properties. Biomaterials are now required to have surfaces with multifunctionality such as favorable tissue integration and the ability to combat bacterial adhesion and colonization. Herein, we report on a simple approach to improving the antibacterial properties of zirconia nanotubes (ZrNT) coatings via decoration with silver nanoparticles (AgNp/Ag2O). This was done by electrochemical anodization of Zr-Ag alloy at a constant voltage in a fluoride-containing electrolyte. The modified ZrNTs were characterized using SEM, EDS, ToF – SIMS, and XPS to determine their structural morphology and chemical composition, and were further subjected to antibacterial testing. The silver and zirconium ion release behavior was also monitored via ICP-MS. ZrNT decorated with AgNp/Ag2O exhibited strong antimicrobial activity (> 99 % bacterial killing) against both S. aureus and E. coli. Antimicrobial tests indicated that the antibacterial activity against the Gram-positive pathogen S. aureus could be improved by a factor of 100 compared to unmodified ZrNT while the unmodified ZrNT showed already a comparable reduction of viable Gram-negative E. coli achieved with the additional AgNp/Ag2O decoration. This modification strategy illustrates a simplified and effective approach toward optimizing the interface between the host environment and the biomaterial surface to meet the very important criteria of biocompatibility and antibacterial properties.

42	One-dimensional Metallicity and π-band Superconductivity in Roh-dizonate Radical Pancakes	Alvaro Lobato; Fernando Izquierdo-Ruiz; Martin Rahm	Computational exploration of condensed phases made of potassium and carbon monoxide leads to predictions of stable salts composed of cyclic six-membered oxocarbon anions and K⁺ cations, K₃(C₆O₆)ₘ. The states of reduction in these systems are wide ranging, with C₆O₆ molecules formally reduced by -2, -3, -3.5 and -6, in semi-conducting and metallic phases. Special attention is paid to K₃C₆O₆, in which triply charged radical anions stack closely and equidistantly in one-dimension. Equidistant interactions of radicals are exceedingly rare and typically unstable due to spontaneous symmetry breaking, Peierls or Jahn-Teller distortion. The notable exception of K₃C₆O₆ is explained by inter-ring multi-center bonding, also known as pancake bonding in combination with large ionic repulsion. This fascinating interplay of interactions facilitates an exceptionally high density of states at the Fermi level and leads us to predictions of extreme metallicity, a negative temperature coefficient of resistivity, and rare π-band superconductivity at ambient conditions of pressure. These predictions reinvigorate the search for new organic conductors and superconductors using molecular design of metallic salts.

43	Organoids Producing Materials	Quentin Moana Perrin; Ali Miserez	Self-organizing tissues, such as organoids, offer transformative potential beyond healthcare by enabling the sustainable production of advanced materials. Resource scarcity and global warming drive the need for innovative fabrication solutions. This prospective review explores developmental biology as a manufacturing process, where the material (e.g., spider silk) and its production unit are self-organized (e.g., silk glands). Biological systems orchestrate the emergence of hierarchical materials with superior mechanical properties and biodegradability, using abundant and renewable resources. Tissue engineering enables the creation of biological systems that surpass current synthetic designs in complexity. We highlight application opportunities, focusing on spider silk as a model to demonstrate how organs synthesize and assemble next-generation materials. The concept of growing both a material and its organ production units is exemplified by hair-bearing organoids, self-organized from induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Key challenges in expanding organoid research to new model species and scaling-up production are discussed alongside potential solutions. We propose a simplified description of these complex systems to help address key challenges. Furthermore, synthetic and hybrid approaches are explored, considering the ethical, societal, and technological impacts. Though still in their infancy, material-producing organoids present a promising avenue for sustainable, high-value products, fostering new interdisciplinary collaborations among bioengineers, developmental biologists, and material scientists. This work aims to inspire further exploration into the applications of self-organized biological systems in addressing global challenges.

45	Photocatalytic Degradation of Ampicillin Under Sunlight Using a Boron Cerium and Silver Ternary Doped Titanium Dioxide Catalyst Synthesized via the EDTA-Citrate Method	Yash Mishra; Dr. Hari Mahalingam	Nowadays, we can see that in river water, traces of antibiotics can be found, which is an emerging problem. Also, pharmaceutical companies’ wastewater contains antibiotic traces present in it in a significant amount which makes it an excellent experimental domain to work upon. Which is very harmful if taken by humans without its treatment, so to treat it as early as possible is very necessary, else the bacteria emerging in that water will be converted to superbugs and then curing the disease from that bacteria will be exceedingly difficult as they have resistive power to that antibiotic. For that, we have prepared a tri-doped photocatalyst by doping boron cerium and silver in a titanium dioxide structure. It can work under sunlight light because the presence of silver in this boron amount is increased so that it can satisfactorily degrade antibiotics. Cerium is for water disinfection in the further catalyst. Its amount was also increased. Then the characterization analysis was performed with the help of DLS analysis with the help of a nanoparticle size analyzer, and we got particle size in the range of 115 to 600 nanometer XRD analysis. We got a band gap of 2.3 to 2.4 electron Volt.BET surface area analysis showed us a surface area of about 25 m²/g. So instead of the UVA lights now, it was performed under the sunlight and the degradation percent was increased significantly to approx 70 percent.

Bamford; Ulrike Werner-Zwanziger; Katherine M. Marczenko; Saurabh S. Chitnis	Tetraarylmethanes and adamantanes are very rare examples of rigid, four-way, anionic connectors that play a scaffolding role in multiple areas of molecular and materials chemistry. We report the synthesis of a tetravalent phosphaza-adamantane cage, (PNSiMe₃)₄(NMe)₆ (2), that shows unusually high ambient, thermal, and redox stability due to its unique geometry. It nevertheless participates in four-fold functionalization reactions on its periphery. The combination of a robust core but a reactive corona makes 2 a convenient inorganic scaffold upon which tetrahedral molecular and macromolecular chemistry can be reliably constructed. This potential is exemplified by the unprecedented synthesis of a tetracationic tetraphosphinimine (3) and the first porous all-P/N polyphosphazene network (5). The unique geometry of tetrahedral, tetravalent molecules makes them valuable scaffolds in synthetic chemistry. Their ability to connect four functional groups in a rigid and well-separated tetrahedral arrangement has allowed development of new optoelectronic materials, thermally-stable energetic compounds, catalysts with enhanced robustness or multi-catalytic sites, bioactive polypeptide frameworks, and pharmaceuticals. In crystalline reticular chemistry, tetrahedral cages are privileged secondary bonding units as their high symmetry facilitates packing, and in amorphous reticular chemistry, tetrahedral connectors have been used to construct hyper-crosslinked polymers or porous organic polymers.

Saunders; Duncan N. Johnstone; Paul A. Midgley	Layered crystal structures are commonly found across organic and inorganic material systems. When in-plane atomic arrangement remains (nearly) identical, a stacking variation of these layers may result in twinning, planar disorder, or polytypes, a form of polymorphism derived from altering stacking sequences. In this work, we use multi-dimensional electron diffraction (ED) modalities to explore the microstructure of xanthine, an archetypal purine base with a layered crystal structure. Firstly, we identify and characterise the twin operator relating domains of Form I xanthine. We then solve the structure of a new xanthine polymorph, revealing that it is a polytype of Form I. Finally, interfaces between twin and polytype domains are visualised, whilst streaking in the diffraction patterns reveals the presence of planar disorder. Given these observations in the xanthine system, this work suggests that disorder on the nanoscale may be a commonly occurring phenomenon in layered organic molecular crystals.

48	Predicting Solubility and Size-Exclusivity Towards the Rational Design of Porous Liquid Solutions	Austin M. Mroz; Benjamin D. Egleston; James Sherwood; Ruby C. Morel; Kim E. Jelfs; Rebecca L. Greenaway	Porous liquids are a sub-class of porous materials that combine permanent porosity, typically associated with solids, with the fluidity and fast mass-transfer capabilities of liquids, making them ideal candidates for gas storage and separation applications. One strategy to form porous liquids is the dissolution of discrete and permanently porous molecular species at relatively high concentrations in cavity-excluded solvents, thus introducing permanent porosity into the liquid in which it is dissolved and ensuring a solution of reasonable porosity is obtained. To access high-performance porous liquids for target applications, the selection of both the porous molecular species and the cavity-excluded solvent is key to ensuring the solvent is permanently excluded and the pore carrier is highly soluble. Finding new solvents that fit both these requirements is challenging, often resulting in a trial-and-error approach. While predictive data-driven models may be attractive, the youth of the porous liquid field currently limits the availability of data necessary to train robust models. Here, we present a computational workflow for the discovery of new porous liquid solutions combining solubility prediction software and a size-exclusivity prediction algorithm, featuring no incorrect size-exclusivity predictions; this is followed by experimental validation with a representative system. Our workflow yielded size-excluded solvent and soluble porous organic cage pairs, leading to the realisation of a new porous liquid with enhanced methane uptake compared to previous systems discovered in a purely experimental high-throughput brute-force manner, highlighting the advantages of incorporating a computational workflow in the discovery of new porous liquids.

49	PROPERTIES, EFFECTS AND CHEMICAL & BIOLOGICAL METHOD OF SYNTHESIS OF SILVER NANOPARTICLES	VARUN MALI	The silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have gained significant attention due to their remarkable properties. Due to the electrical and catalytic properties of silver nanoparticles it is greatly exploited commercially. However, silver nanoparticles adversely affect the environment and can have hazardous, detrimental toxic effects on mammals, non-mammals and plants. The properties of silver nanoparticles greatly depend on the synthesis process conditions such as process type, temperature, pH, concentration of precursor, reducing agents and capping agents used. In this review we have discussed the bottom-up approach which is categorized into chemical synthesis and green synthesis. The chemical synthesis is a conventional method which is used to synthesize silver nanoparticles. However, it does possess major disadvantages as compared to the green synthesis. The green synthesis has gained a significant interest among the researchers as an alternative route to effectively synthesize silver nanoparticles with varying morphology. Green synthesis methods such as viral-biotemplates synthesis using TMV has gained specific attention as it is used in the synthesis of 1D silver nanostructure. The advantages and disadvantages of bottom-up method of silver nanoparticle synthesis is also discussed. This article also provides a critical review on the properties and effects of silver nanostructures.

50	Quantification of azides on the surface of nanoparticles: towards precise bioconjugation	Elizaveta Maksimova; David E. Salazar Marcano; Jonathan De Roo	The precise design of bioconjugated nanoparticles is crucial for effective cell targeting and cellular uptake. Therefore, an accurate approach to creating and quantifying the organic ligand shell with a specific number of conjugated targeting ligands is essential. Click-chemistry has emerged as a robust method for bioconjugation, with azide-alkyne cycloaddition as the most prevalent method. Although nanoparticles are typically functionalized with azides, their quantification has rarely been reported. Here, we present two spectroscopic methods for the surface azide quantification of catechol-stabilized hafnium oxide nanoparticles as a model system. The first method exploits the intrinsic ability of catechol ligands to quench the fluorescence of conjugated fluorophores, whereas the second method represents a general strategy based on monitoring the alkyne absorbance during the click reaction. The latter method is independent of both inorganic core and the ligand shell, allowing it to be generally used. We also demonstrate the broader applicability on hafnium oxide nanoparticles capped with polyphosphonate ligands.

52	An Assessment of drying agents for use in desiccator for teachers, undergraduate and graduates	Marcus Herbig	This article assesses various drying agents suitable for use in desiccators, aimed at teachers, undergraduates, and graduates. Desiccators are essential laboratory tools for drying solids and maintaining low humidity to prevent unwanted reactions. The choice of desiccant is critical, as they reach different residual humidity and perform the drying process with different speed. Additionally, the desiccant can react and therefore remove not only water from the gas phase inside the desiccator. This study details the structure of classical and modern desiccators, the choice of vacuum conditions, and the hazards associated with using certain desiccants. Several desiccants, including calcium chloride, copper(II) sulfate, magnesium perchlorate, and molecular sieves, and others are evaluated, discussing their properties, capacities, and safety considerations. Besides, an experimental setup for measuring humidity absorption rates and residual moisture is outlined. The findings indicate that desiccants like magnesium perchlorate and molecular sieves demonstrate low residual moisture and high absorption speeds, but have disadvantages considering regeneration or safety issues. The article concludes with recommendations for selecting appropriate desiccants based on their characteristics, and ease of use, while acknowledging the need for careful handling of hazardous materials.

53	An integrated assessment of microplastic pollution in coastal surface water and sediment of Japan	Jonathan J. Ramtahal; Kugako Sugimoto; Samantha Phan; Tara Jambio Microplastic Consortium; Yumiko Patouillet; Romain Troublé; Christine K. Luscombe; Sylvain Agostini	The ubiquity of microplastics in the marine environment has been highlighted in recent years, yet the extent of microplastics pollution in coastal areas, especially off the coast of Japan, remains unclear. Here we provide a comprehensive dataset of microplastic pollution in surface water and sediment around coastal Japan. The survey encompasses 14 locations along Japanese coasts from the northernmost in Hokkaido to the southern archipelago of Okinawa. The overall microplastic concentration was 288.7 ± 651.6 g km^{-2} and 1,185 ± 3,829 kg km^{-2} for surface water and sediment, respectively. A total of 53,674 particles were extracted from both sediment and surface water as suspected microplastics using a series of sieving, density separation and digestions. Using Fourier Transform Infrared Spectroscopy, 85% of particles from surface water were identified as plastics and 70% in sediment. The main polymers found were the widely used polyethylene, polypropylene, and polystyrene. Analysis of sources and pathways of microplastics revealed that rainfall, population, aquaculture and fisheries were major driver of microplastic concentrations. This comprehensive survey highlights the rapid sinking of microplastic in coastal areas and the urgent need for better waste management associated with marine activities especially in rural areas.		https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-crmbc	CC BY 4.0
54	Analytical derivatives of symmetry-adapted perturbation theory corrections for interaction-induced properties	Bartosz Tyrcha; Tarun Gupta; Konrad Patkowski; Piotr S. Żuchowski	A new approach that allows for the calculation of interaction-induced properties exclusively from the properties of monomers is presented. The method is derived in the spirit of the symmetry-adapted perturbation theory (SAPT). The interaction-induced property is presented in the first order of the molecular interaction operator, including the exchange effects. Test calculations of the interaction induced dipole moment were carried out for a number of small nonpolar and polar atomic and molecular dimers. The numerical results show that the analytical first-order corrections proposed in this paper reproduce the finite-field treatment of the first-order corrections of SAPT. Compared to supermolecular approaches, the performance of the finite-field SAPT (up to the second order) constitutes an insightful alternative for calculations of interaction-induced properties.

55	Application of proline-2′-deoxymugineic acid as potential fertilizer to alleviate zinc deficiency in paddy soils	Claudia Rocco; Motofumi Suzuki; Ramon Vilar; Enrique García España; Salvador Blasco; Gerald Larrouy-Maumus; Colin Turnbull; Matthias Wissuwa; Xuan Cao; Dominik Weiss	Zinc (Zn) deficiency affects around 50% of rice paddy soils worldwide. This leads to reduced production and poor nutritional composition of food with detrimental consequences to human health. In this work we show that proline-2’-deoxymugineic acid (PDMA), a new synthetic organic ligand, forms strong and stable complexes with zinc(II) in paddy soil conditions and therefore can be used as a novel zinc(II)-fertiliser. To demonstrate this, we determined Zn$^{II}$-binding properties of PDMA and potential competition with other metal ions, identifying the paddy soil conditions where PDMA application is more effective to increase Zn$^{II}$-complexation. Our results indicate that PDMA is a strong Zn$^{II}$-chelator in paddy soil and the most favorable conditions for the effective application of PDMA as Zn$^{II}$-fertilizer is providing PDMA in flooded soil at pH from 7 to 9. In this condition 50% of Zn$^{II}$-complexation is ensured even when Zn$^{II}$ soil concentration is ten times less than competitor metals.

56	Application Software (Video Game) for Teaching and Studying Thermodynamics	Oleksandr Savateev; Yiu Tung Seto; Cheuk Lok Cheng; Jingru Zhuang; Chong Wang	Digital learning and gamification make studying chemistry more exciting and engaging. Interactive digital tools allow students to understand fundamental concepts of chemistry more easily. However, application of this knowledge is hampered by the lack of user-friendly chemistry simulators, in which students could apply their knowledge in a creative way. This paper describes the development of the application software – ChemChellenge. This software is intended for use primarily by undergraduate students studying chemistry and chemical engineering. The goal of the game is to design reaction equations that describe spontaneous chemical reactions. The application software has many features of video games, such as a developed reward system, that is based on principles of thermodynamics, customization of player’s chemistry laboratory and in-game currency. These features make gameplay less linear. As such, multiple solutions to the same task are possible. A case study of using ChemChallenge is described.

57	Benchmarking Mechanical Properties of 3D Printed Elastomeric Microstructures	Or Eivgi; Clara Vazquez-Martel; Jaroslav Lukeš; Eva Blasco	The characterization of mechanical properties in soft 3D printed materials at the microscale remains a significant challenge due to the lack of standardized methodologies. To address this issue, a microscale nanoindentation protocol for elastomeric 3D printed microstructures is developed, optimized, and benchmarked. Herein, a conospherical indenter tip (r = 10.26 µm), a modified trapezoidal displacement profile with lift-off segments to capture adhesion interactions, and the nano-Johnson-Kendall-Roberts model for data analysis is employed. The protocol is optimized and verified using four newly developed PDMS-based inks for two-photon 3D laser printing. The results are compared to a state-of-the-art literature protocol that uses a Berkovich tip and the Oliver-Pharr model. It is shown that adhesion forces play a significant role in mechanical properties overestimation, showing differences of up to 80% between the different protocols. This study highlights the importance of carefully selecting characterization protocol to yield comparable results between studies. By providing a standardized protocol, it paves the way for straightforward and accurate characterization of mechanical properties in soft 3D printed materials at the microscale.

58	C(sp³)–H sulfonylation of light hydrocarbons with sulfur dioxide via hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis in flow	Dmitrii Nagornîi; Fabian Raymenants; Nikolaos Kaplaneris; Timothy Noël	Sulfur-containing scaffolds originating from small alkyl fragments play a crucial role in various pharmaceuticals, agrochemicals, and materials. Nonetheless, their synthesis using conventional methods presents significant challenges. In this study, we introduce a practical and efficient approach that harnesses hydrogen atom transfer photocatalysis to activate volatile alkanes, such as isobutane, butane, propane, ethane, and methane. Subsequently, these nucleophilic radicals react with SO₂ to yield the corresponding sulfinates. These sulfinates then serve as versatile building blocks for the synthesis of diverse sulfur-containing organic compounds, including sulfones, sulfonamides, and sulfonate esters. Our use of flow technology offers a robust, safe and scalable platform for effectively activating these challenging gaseous alkanes, facilitating their transformation into valuable sulfinates.

61	China's rise in the chemical space and the decline of US influence	Marisol Bermúdez-Montaña; Angel García-Chung; Peter F. Stadler; Jürgen Jost; Guillermo Restrepo	At the turn of the 21st century, China has achieved a spectacular surge in the scientific arena. However, little is known about its role in the material core of chemistry, encoded in the chemical space, which spans the discovery of chemicals. Here we show, by analysing the chemical space between 1996 and 2022, that its expansion has been dominated by China ever since 2013. Chinese dominance occurs at different levels, from organic to rare-earth chemistry, but is less dramatic in organometallic chemistry. We also found that Chinese dominance is mainly the product of the country’s own efforts, rather than the result of international collaboration. China’s surge mainly comes at the expense of the contribution of the US. Interestingly, the US share of the chemical space is more dependent on international collaboration, which mainly occurs with China. We also observe the emergent role of India. We believe these results provide a contemporary account of the geopolitics of the chemical space, which may constitute the basis for future national and international science policies, as well as research and development agendas.

62	Chiral Recognition with Room-Temperature Phosphorescence in Guest-Host Energy-Transfer Systems	Biao Chen; Wenhuan Huang; Guoqing Zhang	Chiral recognition with molecular luminescence is a beneficial but challenging method due to an often lack of dramatic difference in intermolecular interactions between the chiral analyte/substrate pair versus their enantiomeric counterpart. Here we show that the difference in room-temperature phosphorescence (RTP) can be substantially augmented by employing guest-host energy-transfer systems. By covalent attachment of chiral amino compounds to a phthalimide host and a naphthalimide guest, respectively, RTP intensity difference of two orders of magnitude with a detection limit of >98% enantiomeric excess (ee) could be achieved. For example, S-enantiomer guests in S-enantiomer hosts produce strong red RTP afterglow while no appreciable RTP could be observed in an S/R guest-host combination. The huge spectroscopic difference in RTP results in conspicuous steady-state and delayed-emission variations, which could easily be discriminated by the naked eye. A generalized concept in solid-state RTP chiral recognition is proposed to expand the application scope of the reported method.

63	Circularly Polarized Stimulated Emission from a Chiral Cavity Based on Apparent Circular Dichroism Organic Thin-Films	Li-Zhi Lin; Ling-Qi Huang; Shi-Wei You; Yi-Jan Huang; Francesco Zinna; Andrew Salij; Lorenzo Di Bari; Randall H. Goldsmith; Roel Tempelaar; Chia-Yen Huang; Tzu-Ling Chen	The lack of intrinsic mirror symmetry in cavity mirrors poses a significant challenge for most organic chiral materials in generating circularly polarized (CP) lasers. However, nonreciprocal chiroptical materials, such as the recently developed organic thin films exhibiting Apparent Circular Dichroism (ACD), provide a promising approach to CP light generation. In this work, we integrate an ACD-based thin film into a free-space dye laser cavity, achieving direct CP laser emission with a degree of circular polarization (DOCP) up to 0.6, corresponding to a dissymmetry factor (glum) of 1.2, a new record for organic chiral lasers. The degree of polarization (DOP) is close to 0.8, and the observed ellipticity in the emitted light originates from the ACD effect in the thin film, leading to asymmetric cavity losses for right- and left-circularly polarized light. This breakthrough demonstrates the potential of ACD-based materials to overcome the limitations of conventional chiral laser systems, marking a significant advancement in the field and paving the way for next-generation chiral photonic devices.

64	Coexistence of Metallocene Cations and Anions	Nico Gino Kub; Robin Sievers; Marc Reimann; Tim-Niclas Streit; Simon Steinhauer; Johanna Schlögl; Martin Kaupp; Moritz Malischewski	We report the synthesis and structural characterization of the rhodocene anion [Rh(C₅(CH₃)₅)(C₅(CF₃)₅)]⁻ [1]⁻ as the [Co(C₅(CH₃)₅)₂]⁺ salt, representing an unprecedented coexistence of metallocene cations and anions in different oxidation states. [1]⁻ was synthesized by the reduction of the rhodocenium cation [Rh(C₅(CH₃)₅)(C₅(CF₃)₅)][BF₄] [1]⁺[BF₄]⁻ with two equivalents of decamethylcobaltocene [Co(C₅(CH₃)₅)₂], since the strongly electron-withdrawing effect of the [C₅(CF₃)₅]⁻ ligand shifts the first and second reduction potentials of [1]⁺ to moderate values of −0.90 V and −1.46 V vs Fc⁺/Fc. The respective salt [Co(C₅(CH₃)₅)₂][1]⁻ was characterized by single crystal X-ray diffraction (XRD), also providing the first example of an isolated and structurally characterized 4d metallocene anion. Whereas the Rh(III) cation has two η⁵-bound Cp ligands, the perfluorinated Cp* ligand is only η³-bound in the Rh(I) anion in order to obey the 18 electron rule. The reduction of the rhodocenium center is also accompanied by a significant shift of the ¹⁰³Rh NMR signal from −9308 ppm [1]⁺ to −6895 ppm [1]⁻ (referenced to Rh(acac)₃), reflecting the change in coordination geometry.

65	Computational design of B,N-substituted graphene ribbons exhibiting quasi-degenerate S₁ and T₁ states and high fluorescence rates	Magdalena W. Duszka; Wolfgang Domcke; Andrzej L. Sobolewski	B,N-substituted graphene ribbons are computationally designed and their spectroscopic properties are systematically explored with wave-function based electronic-structure methods. All B,N-graphene ribbons exhibit exceptionally small S₁-T₁ energy gaps. The oscillator strength of the S₁-S₀ transition increases monotonically with the length of the ribbons. Some B,N-graphene ribbons of intermediate length (5 – 10 rings along the main axis) exhibit a negative singlet-triplet energy gap concurrently with a substantial oscillator strength. The calculated emission energies provide evidence of high rigidity of the ribbons and therefore narrow absorption/emission profiles and low radiationless quenching rates of the emissive S₁ state.

66	Computational Discovery of Stable Metal-Organic Frameworks for Methane-to-Methanol Catalysis	Husain Adamji; Aditya Nandy; Ilia Kevlishvili; Yuriy Román-Leshkov; Heather J. Kulik	The challenge of direct partial oxidation of methane to methanol has motivated the targeted search of metal-organic frameworks (MOFs) as a promising class of materials for this transformation because of their site-isolated metals with tunable ligand environments. Thousands of MOFs have been synthesized, yet relatively few have been screened for their promise in methane conversion. We developed a high-throughput virtual screening (HTVS) workflow that identifies MOFs from a diverse space of experimental MOFs that have not been studied for catalysis, yet are thermally stable, synthesizable, and have promising unsaturated metal sites for C–H activation via a terminal metal-oxo species. We carried out density functional theory (DFT) calculations on the radical rebound mechanism for methane to methanol conversion on models of the secondary building units (SBUs) from 87 selected MOFs. While we showed that oxo formation favorability decreases with increasing 3d filling, consistent with prior work, previously observed scaling relations between oxo formation and hydrogen atom transfer (HAT) are disrupted by the greater diversity in our MOF set. Accordingly, we focused on Mn MOFs, which favor oxo intermediates without disfavoring HAT or leading to high methanol release energies—a key feature for methane hydroxylation activity. We identified three Mn MOFs comprising unsaturated Mn centers bound to weak-field carboxylate ligands in planar or bent geometries with promising methane to methanol kinetics and thermodynamics. The energetic spans of these MOFs are indicative of promising turnover frequencies for methane to methanol that warrant further experimental catalytic studies.

67	Cryogenic milling of consumer plastics for high-throughput characterization of polydisperse, amorphous microplastics	Charlie Maslen; Purnesh Chattopadhyay; Marie Theres Kühne; Gail McConnell; Juliane Simmchen	Microplastics – defined as tiny polymer fragments less than 5 mm in size – pose a clear threat to a wide range of small organisms through ingestion, leading to starvation. In addition, there are many reports of their occurrence both in remote geographical areas and in the human body. Small and made of mostly inert materials, they pose a significant analytical challenge. While primary microplastics i.e., those manufactured intentionally, have defined characteristics, secondary microplastics resulting from the degradation of larger plastic debris are much less understood. Cryogenic milling has emerged as one of the best ways to generate realistic samples with potential for use as references in studies. Here, we use this technique to generate and study the shapes and properties of a wide range of consumer plastics, providing an overview of optical and analytical properties.

68	Deconvoluting Degradation Mechanisms in Anion Exchange Membrane Water Electrolysis using Operando X-ray Microtomography	Iain Malone; Seçil Ünsal; R. S. Young; Matthew P. Jones; Francesco Spanu; Shashidhara Marathe; Rhodri Jervis; Hugh G.C. Hamilton; Christopher M. Zalitis; Thomas S. Miller; Alexander J.E. Rettie	Anion exchange membrane water electrolysers are held back by the low durability of the ionomer in the membrane and catalyst layers. Studying ionomer degradation in these systems is challenging because the main mechanisms, which result in catalyst detachment, membrane thinning and loss of cationic functionality, have opposing effects on the cell potential; electrochemical measurements alone are therefore insufficient for elucidating the underlying causes. To address this, a bespoke miniature-electrolyser-cell was developed for X-ray microtomography imaging of membrane electrode assemblies at 1.6 μm resolution. This set-up enabled the study of the entire active volume of the electrolyser under static and operando conditions and was validated against standard 5 cm² laboratory cells. An operando investigation of degradation in Fumasep® based catalyst coated membranes revealed both significant membrane thinning and loss of membrane ionic conductivity during stability testing, leading to increased ohmic resistance and cell potential. In contrast, a Selemion™ membrane showed minimal changes in thickness and conductivity and was significantly more stable compared to Fumasep® when exposed to synchrotron radiation. This platform has relevance for operando studies of electrochemical materials and devices generally, including proton exchange membrane electrolysers, fuel cells and CO₂ electrolysers using both lab-based and synchrotron X-ray sources.

69	Deep Learning-based Image Caption Generator for Real-time Monitoring and Predictive Control of Concentration of Polluting gases	Yash Mishra; Dr. Kedarnath Senapati	The automatic generation of image captions in natural language is a critical and challenging task, particularly in the context of environmental monitoring and control. This paper presents a novel deep learning-driven image captioning system designed for real-time monitoring and predictive control of pollutant gas concentrations. The proposed system leverages advanced machine learning techniques to analyze images captured during gas capture processes, generating semantically rich and grammatically accurate captions that describe the visual content. At the core of the system is a hybrid architecture that integrates a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for high-level feature extraction from input images and a Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU) for sequential caption generation. The CNN effectively identifies and extracts relevant features from the images, while the GRU models the temporal dependencies inherent in the data, allowing for the generation of coherent and contextually appropriate captions. This dual approach not only enhances the accuracy of the captions but also facilitates a deeper understanding of the processes being monitored. In addition to caption generation, the system incorporates a predictive control module that utilizes the generated captions to forecast future behaviors of the gas capture processes. This predictive capability enables operators to make informed decisions, optimizing the efficiency and effectiveness of pollutant gas management in industrial applications. The proposed system demonstrates significant potential for real-time applications, providing a robust tool for environmental monitoring and control. By enabling the efficient and sustainable utilization of gases, this innovative approach contributes to the broader goal of reducing environmental impact and promoting cleaner industrial practices. The results indicate that deep learning techniques can significantly enhance the capabilities of image captioning systems, paving the way for their application in various domains beyond environmental monitoring.

70	Delving Into the Design and Implementation of Specifications Grading Systems in Higher Education: A Systematic Review	William J. Howitz; Kate J. McKnelly; Renée D. Link	Specifications grading is an alternative grading system that has been used with increasing frequency in higher education. Since first introduced by Linda Nilson in 2014, more than 91 publications on the design and implementation of specifications grading systems have been published. This work presents a systematic review of the current literature to analyze the variety of ways specifications grading systems are executed, including the diverse design and implementation considerations, as well as to present and discuss emergent themes. We analyzed 91 publications and present their relevant findings in the results. The following databases were last searched on October 5, 2024, for publications: IEEE Xplore, ACS Publications, ASEE PEER, PER, Scopus, ERIC, ACM, ScienceDirect, and Web of Science. All peer-reviewed journal articles, conference proceedings, and book chapters that implemented at least two structural features of specifications grading in an undergraduate or graduate course were included in this review. Theses, dissertations, conference abstracts, posters, workshops, blogs, opinion pieces, social media exchanges, and content provided on websites were not included. Additionally, reports of specifications grading systems in K-12 courses or those that only presented the design and/or implementation of less than two structural features of the grading system were similarly excluded. Our findings from the literature reveal that the following themes emerge from educators who use specifications grading: time investment, academic performance, and student reactions. This review provides a resource for those interested in exploring this alternative grading system, and the emergent themes indicate that there are ripe opportunities for future study.

72	A Blueprint for the Synthesis and Characterisation of Thin Graphene Oxide with Controlled Lateral Dimensions for Biomedicine	Artur Filipe Rodrigues; Leon Newman; Neus Lozano; Sourav P. Mukherjee; Bengt Fadeel; Cyrill Bussy; Kostas Kostarelos	Graphene-based materials (GBMs) have ignited a revolution in material science and technology, with electronic, optical and mechanical properties that are of relevant interest for a wide range of applications. To support the development of these enabling technologies, a global research effort has been invested to assess their hazard and biocompatibility. Different production methods have however generated a diverse collection of GBMs with different physicochemical properties, leading to a variety of biological outcomes that are still not fully understood. To better understand the biological interactions of GBMs with biological systems and allow the design of safer materials, a thorough physicochemical characterisation is therefore highly recommended. The aim of the present work was to produce a blueprint for the synthesis and characterisation of non-pyroelectric graphene oxide (GO) flakes with three different controlled lateral dimensions, which could be further used for either hazard assessment or biomedical proof-of-concept studies. A battery of techniques used to characterise the physicochemical properties of the GO samples included atomic force microscopy, transmission electron microscopy, Fourier-transformed infra-red spectroscopy, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and Raman spectroscopy. The combination of these different techniques confirmed that only the lateral dimension varied among the GO materials produced, without significant change in any other of their fundamental physicochemical properties, such as the thickness or surface chemistry. The proposed systematic approach in GO batch production for biology will hopefully contribute to a better understanding of the material properties that govern their interactions with biological systems and offer a blueprint towards standardisation of biologically relevant 2D materials.

73	A Carrier-free Peptide Co-assembled System with Synergistic Antitumor Effect Combines Immunotherapy and Sonodynamic Therapy	Limin Zhang; Weizhi Wang	Blocking programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) in tumor cells is an effective therapy strategy to achieve immune system activation for tumor therapy, however only a few patients can benefit from it. Development of synergistic therapy with checkpoint PD-L1 blockade immunotherapy is beneficial to enhance antitumor effect. Herein, we constructed a carrier-free system EH@Ag₂S co-assembled by peptide nanofiber and Ag₂S nsanoparticles to achieve a superadditive (1 + 1 > 2) antitumor effect. EH nanofiber can block PD-L1, and Ag₂S can produce reactive oxygen species (ROS) under ultrasound irradiation and induce cell apoptosis. Further, in vivo mice experiment also confirmed the high efficiency of this carrier-free co-assembled system in successfully inducing anti-tumor response while inhibiting tumor growth. We believe that this highly bioavailable and multifunctional therapeutic system may become a promising nanoplatform for tumor therapy.

74	A Chemical Language Model for Molecular Taste Prediction	Authors not provided in the provided text	Determining molecular taste remains a significant challenge in food science. Here, we present FART (Flavor Analysis and Recognition Transformer), a chemical language model capable of predicting molecular taste from chemical structure. Trained on the largest public dataset (15,025 compounds) of molecular tastants to date, FART is the first model capable of parallel predictions across four fundamental taste categories: sweet, bitter, sour, and umami. FART achieves an accuracy above 91% for parallel taste prediction and outperforms previous state-of-the-art binary classifier models that specialize on predicting one taste class. Its transformer architecture allows for interpretability through gradient-based visualization of molecular features. The model identifies key structural elements driving taste properties and demonstrates utility in analyzing known tastants as well as novel compounds. By making both the model and the dataset publicly available, we provide the food science community with tools for rapid taste prediction, potentially accelerating the development of new flavor compounds and enabling systematic exploration of taste chemistry.

75	A Closer Look at the Substituent Effects on the Copolymerization of Thionolactones by Radical Ring-Opening Polymerization	Bastien Luzel; Lucas Raggio; Eytan Benharrous; Julien Monot; Didier Bourissou; Didier Siri; Didier Gigmes; Catherine Lefay; Blanca Martin-Vaca; Yohann Guillaneuf	The negative impact of plastic waste on the environment is a serious issue for the future. Adding cleavable bonds in the polymer backbone can help to impart degradability properties. To this end, radical ring opening polymerization (rROP) offers a very attractive way through radical copolymerization with vinyl monomers. Thionolactones, one of the various cyclic monomers that can be used in rROP, are promising structures due to the efficiency of the C=S bond in acting as a radical acceptor. In this work, we used DFT calculations to better understand the effects of different substituents on the radical reactivity of thionolactones (dibenzo[c,e]oxepane-5-thione DOT derivatives) already described as more or less effective for copolymerization with vinyl monomers in order to adjust the reactivity of these thionolactones. To carry out these calculations, we focused on the value of the transfer constant $k_0$ and its relationship to the propagation constant $k_p$ of the vinyl monomer. The calculations performed subsequently on 7-phenyloxepane-2-thione (POT) derivatives highlighted that electron-donating groups inserted in para-position on the phenyl ring should improve the copolymerization efficiency with acrylate derivatives and in contrary electron-withdrawing groups should lead to more important compositional drift during styrene and acrylate copolymerization. Although POT derivatives bearing electron-donating groups could not be prepared, the preparation of those with CF$_3$ and NO$_2$ groups was successfully achieved. Experimental copolymerization of these two thionolactones with styrene and isobornyl acrylate are in good agreement with the calculations. This result confirmed the versatility and relevance of our calculation approach to account for the reactivity of thionolactones.

76	A Cobalt-Iron Double-Atom Catalyst for the Oxygen Evolution Reaction	Lichen Bai; Chia-Shuo Hsu; Duncan T.L. Alexander; Hao Ming Chen; Xile Hu	Single atom catalysts exhibit well-defined active sites and potentially maximum atomic efficiency. However, they are unsuitable for reactions that benefit from bimetallic promotion such as the oxygen evolution reaction (OER) in alkaline medium. Here we show that a single atom Co precatalyst can be in-situ transformed into a Co-Fe double atom catalyst for OER. This catalyst exhibits one of the highest turnover frequencies among metal oxides. Electrochemical, microscopic, and spectroscopic data including those from operando X-ray absorption spectroscopy, reveal a dimeric Co-Fe moiety as the active site of the catalyst. This work demonstrates double-atom catalysis as a promising approach for the development of defined and highly active OER catalysts.

77	A Combined Kinetic and Computational Analysis of the Palladium-Catalysed Formylation of Aryl Bromides	Georgina Rai; Lee J. Edwards; Rebecca L. Greenaway; Philip W. Miller; Katherine M. P. Wheelhouse; Mark R. Crimmin	Aryl aldehydes are key synthetic intermediates in the manufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients. They are generated on scale (>1000 kg) through the palladium-catalysed formylation of aryl bromides using syngas (CO:H₂). The best-in-class catalyst system for this reaction employs di-1-adamantyl-n-butylphosphine (cataCXium â A), palladium(II) acetate, and tetramethylethylenediamine. Despite nearly 20 years since its initial report, a mechanistic understanding of this system remains incomplete. Here we use automation, kinetic analysis, and DFT calculations to develop a new mechanistic model for this best-in-class catalyst. We show that a combination of the migratory insertion step and dihydrogen activation step are likely involved in the turnover-limiting sequence. The reaction kinetics are responsive to the nature of the substrate, with electron-rich aryl bromides reacting faster and more selectively than their electron-poor counterparts due to the influence of electronics in the migratory insertion step. Our findings overturn the current paradigm and provide new mechanistic insight into palladium-catalysed formylation of aryl bromides.

79	A Database of Low-Energy Atomically Precise Nanoclusters	Sukriti Manna; Alberto Hernandez; Yunzhe Wang; Peter Lile; Shanping Liu; Tim Mueller	The chemical and structural properties of atomically precise nanoclusters are of great interest in numerous applications, but the structures of the clusters can be computationally expensive to predict. In this work, we present the largest database of cluster structures and properties determined using ab-initio methods to date. We report the methodologies used to discover low-energy clusters as well as the energies, relaxed structures, and physical properties (such as relative stability, HOMO-LUMO gap among others) for over 50,000 clusters across 55 elements. We have identified 589 structures which have energies lower than any previously reported in the literature by at least 1 meV/atom, and we have identified 1340 new structures for clusters that were previously unexplored in the literature. Patterns in the data reveal insights into the chemical and structural relationships among the elements at the nanoscale. We describe how the database can be accessed for future studies and the development of nanocluster-based technologies.

80	A Fast Neural Network for Isotopic Charge State Assignment	John G. Pavek; Nicholas E. Bollis; Josiah Grimes; Michael R. Shortreed; Lloyd M. Smith; Michael T. Marty	Electrospray ionization (ESI) mass spectrometry is an essential technique for chemical analysis in a range of fields. In ESI, analytes can produce multiple charge states, which must be correctly assigned for identification. Existing approaches to charge state assignment can suffer from limited accuracy and/or poor speed. Here, we developed a fast deep learning neural network to perform isotopic cluster charge assignment. The performance of our algorithm, IsoDec, was demonstrated on top-down proteomics spectra collected on diverse instruments. On these highly complex individual spectra, we found that IsoDec produces similar sequence coverage to existing software tools but with improved accuracy. Importantly, this performance enhancement stems directly from the neural network charge assignment approach, not simply improved scoring and filtering of isotopic clusters. Finally, when applied to large top-down proteomics data sets, we discovered that IsoDec produces proteoform-spectrum matches with a better combination of coverage and accuracy. Overall, IsoDec provides a compelling demonstration of the potential of lightweight neural networks in mass spectrometry data analysis for diverse applications.

81	A Green and Fast Method for PEDOT: Photoinduced Step-Growth Polymerization of EDOT	Kerem Kaya	The first green and fast photoinduced step-growth polymerization of 3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene (EDOT) producing high molecular weight poly (3,4-ethylenedioxythiophene) (PEDOT) is reported. Phenacyl bromide was used as a single-component photoinitiating system under a broad wavelength range. The reported photooxidative polymerization technique has several advantages over the conventional oxidation methods (chemical/electrochemical) such as the use of green solvent and ambient conditions (room temperature and air atmosphere), doping of the polymer with bromide ions during the photopolymerization reaction, possibility to perform bulk photopolymerization and tune the irradiation wavelength depending on the phenacyl bromide concentration. Doped PEDOT synthesized under near-UV irradiation was thoroughly investigated using different spectral and chromatographic methods. It has high conductivity (1.6 S/cm), high molecular weight (32.5 kg/mol) and strong white light photoluminescence.

The complex was fully characterized by single-crystal X-ray diffraction analyses, spectroscopic and (photo)magnetic studies. Single crystal X-ray analyses revealed that the complex exhibits a three-dimensional (3D) hexagonal network structure of molybdenum(V) and iron(II) centers bridged by the cyanide ligands. The partially desolvated form 1:2DMF exhibit thermo-induced spin crossover (SCO) between LS Fe(II) and HS Fe(II) center over a wide range of temperature and light-controlled spin-state switching phenomenon at low temperature under light irradiation with T1/2 = 70 K whereas the fully solvated complex 1:2DMF·H2O remains in the HS state. This complex represents the first 3D coordination complex consists of iron(II) and [Mo(V)(CN)]3− units exhibiting reversible and complete SCO phenomenon and photo-magnetic effect.

83	A New Perspective on Aqueous Electrolyte Solutions	Gerhard Schwaab; Simone Pezzotti	Aqueous electrolyte solutions are central to many natural phenomena and industrial applications leading to continuous development of increasingly complex analytical models. These are based on an atomistic description of ion-ion electrostatic interactions combined with mean-field approaches for the dielectric response of water. Despite many achievements, these concepts fail to quantitatively describe situations where ion-ion correlation and specific solvation become relevant, such as for concentrated electrolyte solutions. Here, we propose a change of perspective, by introducing a statistical, coarse-grained view to describe the average thermodynamic properties of aqueous electrolyte solutions. This approach bypasses the need to define ion-pairs or ion-complexes and does not require any prior knowledge on specific solvation. We base our concept on separating the solution into a spherical observation droplet whose size and average composition are uniquely determined by the solution parameters, and its environment consisting of the remaining solution. This allows us to express the droplet-environment interaction in terms of a generalized multipole expansion, i.e. in a convenient, additive way. We applied this approach to 135 electrolytes including some notoriously complex electrolytes, such as LiCl or ZnCl$_2$ over the full solubility range. This paves the road toward understanding super-saturated and water-in-salt solutions and electrolyte nucleation.

84	A REVIEW ON APPLICATIONS AND PREPARATION METHODS USED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CURCUMIN NANOPARTICLE	Varun R. Mali	The design and development of Curcumin nanoparticles has attracted and established torrential research in nano formulation matrix. By appearance Curcumin is an orange crystalline powder which is derived or obtained from the herbs Curcumin Longa Linn (Zingiberaceae). The Curcumin is natural hydrophobic polyphenol compound which has proven to be a quintessential medicine in ancient China and many parts of Southeast and central Asia. Curcumin as a substance is vitally used in medicine and some food industry as it supplies many biological and pharmacological activities such as antioxidant, anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, anti-illness and diseases but clinical application of this compound is limited due to its bioavailability, poor water solubility, fast metabolism and susceptibility to degradation in the alkaline medium. The most important methods to enhance the poor biopharmaceutical properties of Curcumin is to enhance aqueous solubility and bioavailability by using nanotechnology and nanoparticles having a small size in nanometer range. This review provides an overview of application and preparation of Curcumin nanoparticles including the advantages and limitations.

87	Accurate Free Energy Calculation via Multiscale Simulations Driven by Hybrid Machine Learning and Molecular Mechanics Potentials	Xujian Wang; Xiongwu Wu; Bernard R. Brooks; Junmei Wang	"Our study focused on the implementation and testing of machine learning interatomic potentials (MLIPs) into the AMBER software suite. This implementation enables us to perform a novel type of molecular dynamics simulation utilizing the hybrid machine learning/molecular mechanics (ML/MM) potentials. To underpin the capabilities of ML/MM simulations, we first validated our implementation at a fundamental physical level by confirming energy and momentum conservation laws. The successful validation indicates that our implementation is able to produce adequate and physically interpretable samplings. Building upon this, for the first time to the best of our knowledge, we proposed an ML/MM-compatible thermodynamic integration (TI) protocol to tackle real-world challenges, such as solvation free energy calculation. Our results demonstrate that this computational protocol can predict hydration free energies with an accuracy of less than 1.00 kcal/mol compared to experimental data, paving the way for the use of ML/MM in multiscale simulations to addressing future drug design problems. Moreover, by applying ML/MM in molecular dynamics simulations of protein-ligand complexes, we demonstrated that the adequate samplings enable us to accurately reproduce experimental binding free energies. Thus, our implementation can offer new insights into biomolecular systems using the ML/MM ""microscope"". Last, we demonstrated that our implementation can achieve nanosecond timescale simulations daily after significant effort being put to improve the code performance. In a conclusion, we have successfully implemented ML/MM potential to AMBER software package after overcoming limitations in current multi-scale simulations including low computational efficiency. We have advanced TI theory allowing us to accurately predict free energies with ML/MM potentials."

89	Advanced Computational Insights into Ni(II) Schiff Base Complexes: Addressing Sluggish Kinetics and Stability Challenges in Oxygen Reduction Reaction Catalysis	Chidi Daniel Chukwu	The development of efficient and stable catalysts for the oxygen reduction reaction (ORR) remains a critical challenge in the pursuit of next-generation energy technologies. In this study, we designed and investigated a Ni (II) Schiff base complex as a potential solution to address the sluggish kinetics and stability limitations of ORR catalysts. A comprehensive computational approach was adopted, integrating ChemDraw for molecular modeling, DMol³ in Material Studio for electronic structure and catalytic property calculations, and MATLAB for precise overpotential analysis. The Ni (II) complex demonstrated a significantly lower overpotential (−0.55) compared to its Co(II) counterpart (−4.95), highlighting its superior catalytic efficiency and faster reaction kinetics. The Schiff base ligand, with its robust chelating ability and electronic tunability, facilitated the stabilization of intermediates and optimized the electronic properties of the Ni (II) center, enabling efficient electron transfer and intermediate transitions. Gibbs free energy calculations revealed a pathway with hydroperoxide (HO₂⁻) as the first intermediate, further validating the thermodynamic feasibility and kinetic superiority of the Ni (II) complex. These findings underscore the Schiff base ligand as an ideal framework for designing high-performance catalysts and demonstrate the potential of the Ni (II) complex for ORR applications in fuel cells and metal-air batteries. This study provides valuable insights into leveraging computational tools for catalyst design and emphasizes the need for further exploration of Schiff base ligands in energy catalysis to address global energy demands.

90	Advancing Dearomative Difluoromethylation of $N$-heterocycles and Pharmaceuticals	Sandeep Kumawat; Tarun Bhatt; Kishore Natte	Given the significant prevalence of $N$-heterocycles in small-molecule pharmaceuticals, the selective incorporation of a difluoromethyl (-CF2H) motif and the creation of a new functional group within the same molecular framework are of paramount importance in drug discovery and development. However, such integrated approaches remain underexplored, presumably due to the lack of efficient synthetic methods. In the present research, we introduce a new platform and broadly applicable technique for the difluoromethylation of various $N$-heterocyclic substrates using low-cost and commercially available bromo(difluoro)acetic acid in the presence of K2CO3 at room temperature to produce >70 desired complex Het-NCF2H products featuring either imine and/or ketone functional group, which were hitherto impossible to produce. Depending on the type of $N$-heterocycle, this advance also permits the inclusion of two CF2H units. Crucial to success is the more nucleophilicity and less steric hindrance on the nitrogen atom of the heteroarene ring that enables $N$-difluoromethylative dearomatization of $N$-heterocycles. Overall, this unique transformation was transition metal-free, practical, scalable (>50 grams), tolerant to diverse reactive functional groups with excellent chemoselectivity, adaptable to diversities of challenging $N$-heteroaromatic ring systems, and could be used for the late-stage diversification of 18 commercial drug molecules. Mechanistic investigation revealed the formation of $N$-difluoromethylquinolinium salt as a key intermediate, which occurs via nucleophilic substitution followed by decarboxylation with bromo(difluoro)acetic acid. Ultimately, we have also unveiled a prominent synthetic application for rapid hydrodefluorinative reduction in a single step to access complex $N$-methylated Fsp^3-enriched motif. This cost-effective strategy encompasses a full package of medicinally important functionalities (heterocycle, -NCF2H, and imine/keto), making them highly valuable in the preparation of chemical libraries and effective drugs.

91	Amide - amine + alcohol = carboxylic acid." Chemical reactions as linear algebraic analogies in graph neural networks.	Amer Marwan El-Samman; Stijn De Baerdemacker	In deep learning methods, especially in the context of chemistry, there is an increasing urgency to uncover the hidden learning mechanisms often dubbed as “black box.” This work shows that graph models built on computational chemical data behave similar to natural language processing (NLP) models built on text data. Atom-embeddings exhibit arithmetic properties that represent valid reaction formulas, similar to word analogies in NLP models. The observations find applications in transfer learning and uncover a latent model of chemistry that is highly structured, consistent, and analogous to chemical syntax.

Morton; Alvaro Keskküla; J. Mark Sutton; Charlotte K. Hind; Michelle D. Garrett; Cally J. E. Haynes; Jennifer R. Hiscock	Differences in the lipid composition of prokaryotic and eukaryotic cell membranes are well understood and can be exploited to produce novel antimicrobials. However, what is less well recognised is that alteration in the phospholipid composition of the cell membrane is also one of the first phenotypic changes when a cell becomes cancerous. In addition, changes in phospholipid cell membrane composition are a known cause of drug resistance in both microbial disease and cancer. Here we present a series of chiral, amino acid appended supramolecular self-associating amphiphiles that suggest membrane active technologies can be used to simultaneously produce novel drugs in the fight against two of the greatest global health threats facing us today, antimicrobial resistant infections and cancer diseases. We demonstrate the antimicrobial and anticancer efficacy of this membrane active amphiphile technology against susceptible and resistant Staphylococcus aureus and ovarian cancer cells. We hypothesise a mode of action, building on a previous body of evidence, through a combination of vesicle, NMR spectroscopy and patch clamp experiments. We also provide evidence that supports the potential for this class of compound to be developed as pharmaceutical agents against these diseases through in vitro drug metabolism and pharmacokinetics experiments alongside in vivo Galleria mellonella toxicity experiments.

Many TADF design strategies are first applied in compounds that contain triazines, and there are numerous examples of OLEDs with triazine-containing emitters that show high efficiencies and long operating lifetimes. We provide a comprehensive review of triazine-containing TADF emitters. This review is organized according to the triazine-derived structural motifs, such as number and position of electron-donor groups in donor-acceptor type emitters, the π-bridging linkers employed, and the design of through-space charge-transfer (TSCT) emitter. We correlate the structure of the compounds with their optoelectronic properties and the corresponding performance of the organic light-emitting diode devices.

94	1’-cyano substitution of Remdesivir exerts the “template-dependent” inhibition on the viral transcription of SARS-CoV-2	Xueying Luo; Xiaowei Wang; Xin Gao; Lu Zhang	Remdesivir is one nucleotide analog prodrug capable to terminate RNA synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 RdRp by two distinct mechanisms. The “delayed chain termination mechanism” has been extensively investigated, while the “template-dependent inhibition mechanism” remains elusive. In this study, we have demonstrated that Remdesivir embedded in the template strand seldom directly disrupted the complementary NTP incorporation at the active site. Instead, the translocation of the template strand from +2 to +1 site was hindered, as the 1’-cyano group of Remdesivir would sterically clash with V557. Moreover, we have elucidated the molecular mechanism of how SARS-CoV-2 RdRp gained the drug resistance to Remdesivir upon V557L mutation. Overall, our studies provided valuable insight into the “template-dependent inhibition mechanism” exerted by Remdesivir on SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and paved venues for an alternative drug design strategy for the treatment of COVID-19. The outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has become a global pandemic, and over 455 million confirmed cases have been reported by March, 2022. Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) is the novel coronavirus that has caused COVID-19 and can be furtively transmitted among humans. To curb the healthy crisis, great efforts have been devoted to exploring the effective treatment for COVID-19. The core polymerase complex of SARS-CoV-2 has become one promising antiviral drug target. It is the minimal scaffold to mediate the RNA synthesis and plays a central role in viral replication and transcription. It is composed of three non-structural proteins (nsp) (Fig. 1A), where nsp12 mainly conducts the RNA synthesis in the active site, and nsp7 and nsp8 serve as cofactors to stimulate RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity. Since the outbreak of the pandemic, nucleotide analogs have been widely explored as potential inhibitors to terminate the RNA synthesis in SARS-CoV-2 RdRp. Remdesivir is one representative nucleotide analog prodrug that has demonstrated therapeutic efficacy in the animal model of SARS-CoV-2 RdRp and effectively terminated viral RNA synthesis in the biochemical experiments through “delayed termination mechanism”. The chemical structure of Remdesivir’s active form (RDV-TP) resembles that of natural adenosine triphosphate (ATP). Previous studies have demonstrated that RDV-TP can efficiently compete with ATP incorporating into the nascent strand. However, three NTPs can still be consecutively added into the nascent strand after the incorporation of RDV-TP and the termination is delayed. This is because that the 1’-cyano group of Remdesivir could form steric and electrostatic interactions with the protein residues when it translocates from -3 to -4 site. In addition, biochemical experiments have further demonstrated that such termination can be overcome by increasing the concentration of the NTP pool and the full-length product containing Remdesivir in the RNA strand can be formed under biologically relevant condition. Intriguingly, an alternative but more dominant inhibitory mechanism of Remdesivir on SARS-CoV-2 RdRp has been proposed, in which Remdesivir shows stronger resistance to the NTP concentration increment when it was present at the template strand. In this scenario, the copy of RNA strand embedded with Remdesivir was used as the template and exerted the “template-dependent inhibition”, where the UTP incorporation complementary to Remdesivir is inhibited. Interestingly, such inhibition can be significantly reduced by the point mutation V557L. These observations have altogether suggested that the presence of Remdesivir at the template strand offers the second oppo	Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry	https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2022-25cs3	CC BY 4.0
95	11B NMR Together with IR Spectroscopy Provides Insight into Structural Elucidation of Quadrivalent Diazaborines & Cyclic Boronate Esters: The Chemist’s Perspective	Ashley L. Dey	Imidazo-fused diazaborines which serve as intermediary structures somewhat along benzene and borazine had been of particular interest to Dewar and Snyder more than 60 years ago. To this end, Dewar utilised his ‘π-complex theory’ so as to represent ‘borazaro’ as ‘quadrivalent’ species; however, sadly modern representations have deviated and leapt into ‘trivalent’ counterparts. Inasmuch as bonding in boron species has never been straightforward to such an extent that the orthodox ‘ethane’ like diborane i.e. H3B–BH3 which conferred to the paradigmatic rules of molecular structure, in particular, hybridisation and electronegativity was later evolved to a more realistic ‘3-centre 2-electron’ bonding, so as to give the lie to the purported diborane structures of X-ray diffractors, herein 11B NMR together with IR spectroscopy sheds light on the nature of bonding in borazaro and ‘caged’ cyclic oxazaboronos so as to reenforce and reinvigorate the old literature which could be of interests to the synthetic and medicinal chemist alike.

Hilliard; Shivani Sharma; Casey R. Wade; Phillip J. Milner; Gábor Csányi; Alexander C. Forse	Carbon dioxide capture technologies are set to play a vital role in mitigating the current climate crisis. Solid-state ^{17}O NMR spectroscopy can provide key mechanistic insights that are crucial to effective sorbent design and development. In this work, we present the fundamental aspects and complexities for the study of hydroxide-based CO2 capture systems by ^{17}O NMR spectroscopy. We perform static DFT NMR calculations to assign peaks for general hydroxide CO2 capture products, finding that ^{17}O NMR can readily distinguish between bicarbonate, carbonate and water species. However, in application to CO2 binding in two test case hydroxide-functionalised metal-organic frameworks – MFU-4l and KHCO3-CD-MOF, we find that a dynamic treatment is necessary to obtain agreement between computational and experimental spectra. We therefore introduce a workflow that leverages machine-learning force fields to capture dynamic effects across multiple chemical exchange regimes, providing a significant improvement on static DFT predictions. In MFU-4l, we parameterise, in a pre-determined fashion, a two-component dynamic motion of the bicarbonate motif involving a rapid carbonyl seesaw motion and intermediate hydroxyl proton hopping. For KHCO3-CD-MOF, we combined experimental and modelling approaches to propose a new mixed carbonate-bicarbonate binding mechanism and thus, we open new avenues for the study and modelling of hydroxide-based CO2 capture materials by ^{17}O NMR spectroscopy.

97	2019-nCoV vs. SARS-CoV: Which Truly Has a Higher ACE2 Affinity? A Quantum Chemical Perspective on Virus-Receptor Noncovalent Interactions	Nitai Sylvetsky	While the title question is still a matter for ongoing debate, current hypotheses suggest that a few particular amino acid substitutions are responsible for the ACE2 affinity differences between the two viruses (the spike proteins of which exhibit 76% sequence identity, and are therefore assumed to adopt similar folded structures). In the present paper, noncovalent interaction energetics associated with said substitutions are assessed by means of B3LYP/TZVP electronic structure calculations on a representative set of geometries – chosen to reflect different biochemically-significant spatial organizations of the amino acid residues at hand. We found that the sum and (unbiased-)average of calculated interaction energetics under consideration are larger in SARS-CoV compared to 2019-nCoV. Thus, we hereby challenge earlier predictions claiming a higher ACE2 affinity for 2019-nCoV employing “chemical-intuition”-based analyses of said substitutions alone. We also demonstrate that the latter predictions are potentially somewhat-biased for being based on a SARS-CoV–ACE2 crystal structure – which should not be expected to represent a bound spike-protein–receptor complex in physiological conditions. By comparing electronic-structure-based results with ones obtained using the widely-used MMFF94 molecular mechanics force-field, we show that despite being specifically parametrized for van der Waals interactions – such classical force fields might prove inadequate in cases where only several, well-defined noncovalent binding factors are assumed to play crucial roles in biochemically-significant binding events.

Wide-range application crucially requires high-performance photocatalysts that are environmentally benign and free of precious metals. With high robustness, controllable composition, tunable electronic structure and high porosity, two-dimensional conjugated polymers (2DCPs) are among the most appealing candidates. We provide rational design principles for 2DCPs which are suitable for water splitting, highlight progress and open challenges in synthesis, and review the recent theory-based investigations on 2DCPs for photocatalysis. The role of theory as indispensable tool is highlighted, as it promotes the understanding of the inner relationship between geometry, electronic structure and photocatalytic performance of 2DCPs and therefore enables rational design of new photocatalysts.

100	2D Mixed Halide Perovskites for Ultraviolet Light-emitting Diodes	Manchen Hu; Junrui Lyu; Natalia Murrietta; Sebastian Fernández; William Michaels; Qi Zhou; Pournima Narayanan; Daniel N. Congreve	Advances in perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) have established them as viable candidates for next-generation displays and lighting across the entire visible spectrum, with recent investigations extending their emissive properties into the deep blue and violet regions. These materials have the potential to overcome the fabrication complexities inherent in conventional III-V semiconductors by circumventing the necessity for lattice-matching, instead allowing for straightforward deposition of polycrystalline films without relying on metal-organic chemical vapor deposition. However, achieving shorter emission wavelengths presents a significant challenge due to the larger bandgaps required of both the perovskite and charge transport materials, compounding the difficulty in managing electron-hole pair recombination dynamics necessary for efficient electroluminescence. In this work, we address these challenges by precisely tuning the halide composition in two-dimensional perovskites, successfully extending the bandgap to 3.1 eV and achieving photoluminescent emission at 393 nm. By introducing an optimized dual electron transport layer architecture, we improve electron injection and hole confinement within the perovskite matrix, culminating in a high-purity electroluminescent emission at 399 nm. This strategy yields a maximum external quantum efficiency of 0.16%, a new benchmark for PeLEDs operating in this spectral domain. These findings highlight the potential of large bandgap perovskite materials for next-generation light-emitting applications.

Neumann	Transition-metal-catalyzed cleavage of the Si–H bond in silanes to yield silyl radicals requires substantial amounts of energy, which is commonly supplied by photons. Within the MOF, an uncommonly facile direct silyl radical transfer to olefin substrates is possible, enabling thermal olefin hydrosilylation at room temperature. The assembly of a tri-component transition state comprised of Rh(II), silylene, and ethylene bypasses the high-energy silyl radical species, enabling silyl radical transfer with an activation free energy ~15 kcal mol⁻¹ below the minimum energy barrier for silyl radical formation. Direct observation of the 3c-3e silane σ-adduct and quantum mechanical calculations support the findings.

102	31P NMR chemical shift anisotropy in paramagnetic lanthanide phosphide complexes	Jack Baldwin; Katherine L. Bonham; Toby R. C. Thompson; Gemma K. Gransbury; George F. S. Whitehead; Iñigo J. Vitorica-Yrezabal; Daniel Lee; Nicholas F. Chilton; David P. Mills	Lanthanide (Ln) magnetic resonance imaging and chiral shift reagents generally exploit 1H NMR shifts, as paramagnetic broadening tends to preclude the use of heavier, less sensitive nuclei. Here we report the solution and solid-state 31P NMR shifts of an isostructural series of distorted trigonal bipyramidal Ln(III) tris-silylphosphide complexes, [Ln{P(SiMe3)2}3(THF)2] (1-Ln; Ln = La, Ce, Pr, Nd, Sm); 1-Ln were also characterized by elemental analysis, single crystal and powder X-ray diffraction, multinuclear NMR, EPR, ATR-IR, and UV-Vis-NIR spectroscopy, and SQUID magnetometry. Breaking assumptions, we observed paramagnetically broadened 31P NMR spectra for the Ln-bound P atoms for the 1-Ln family; in solution, 1-Nd showed the most downfield chemical shift (δ31P = 2570.14 ppm) and 1-Sm the most upfield value (δ31P = -259.21 ppm). We determined the span of the chemical shift anisotropies (CSA) for solid 1-Ln using magic angle spinning NMR spectroscopy; the CSA was largest for 1-Pr (Ω31P ≈ 2000 ppm), consistent with a combination of paramagnetism and the relatively large differences in pyramidalization of the three P atoms in the solid-state. Density functional theory calculations for 1-La were in excellent agreement with the experimentally-determined 31P NMR parameters. We find good agreement of experimental 1H NMR chemical shifts with ab initio-calculated values for paramagnetic 1-Ln, whilst the shifts of heavier 13C, 29Si and 31P nuclei are not well-reproduced due to the current limitations of paramagnetic NMR calculations for nuclei with large contact shifts.

103	3D Based Generative PROTAC Linker Design with Reinforcement Learning	Baiqing Li; Ting Ran; Hongming Chen	Proteolysis targeting chimeras (PROTACs), have emerged as an effective therapeutic modality by harnessing the ubiquitin-proteasome system to selectively induce targeted protein degradation, with the potential to modulate traditional undruggable targets. Due to its hetero-bifunctional characteristics, in which a linker joins warhead binding to a protein of interest, conferring specificity, and E3 ligand binding to an E3 ubiquitin ligase, a PROTAC molecule can form a PROTAC ternary structure for bring the protein of interest to the vicinity of the E3 ligase. The rational PROTAC linker design is challenging due to its relatively large molecular weight and the complexity of maintaining the binding mode of warhead and E3-ligand in the binding pockets of counterpart. Conventional linker generation method can only generate linkers in either 1D SMILES or 2D graph, without taking into account the information of ternary structures. Here we propose a novel 3D linker generative model PROTAC-INVENT which can not only generate SMILES of PROTAC but also its 3D putative binding conformation coupled with the target protein and the E3 ligase. The model is trained jointly with the RL approach to bias the generation of PROTAC structures toward pre-defined 2D and 3D based properties. Examples were provided to demonstrate the utility of the model for generating reasonable 3D conformation of PROTACs. On the other hand, our results show that the associated workflow for 3D PROTAC conformation generation can also be used as an efficient docking protocol for PROTACs.

104	3D Printable Modular Soft Elastomers from Physically Crosslinked Homogeneous Associative Polymers	Myeoum Kim; Shifeng Nian; Daniel A. Rau; Baiqiang Huang; Jinchang Zhu; Guillaume Freychet; Mikhail Zhernenkov; Li-Heng Cai	Three-dimensional (3D) printing of elastomers enables the fabrication of many technologically important structures and devices. However, there remains a critical need for the development of reprocessable, solvent-free soft elastomers that can be printed without the need for post-treatment. Here, we report modular soft elastomers suitable for direct ink write (DIW) printing by physically crosslinking associative polymers with a high fraction of reversible bonds. We design and synthesize linear-associative-linear (LAL) triblock copolymers; the middle block is an associative polymer carrying amide groups that form double hydrogen bonding, and the end blocks aggregate to hard glassy domains that effectively act as physical crosslinks. The amide groups do not aggregate to form nanoscale clusters and only slow polymer dynamics without changing the shape of the linear viscoelastic spectra; this enables molecular control over energy dissipation by varying the fraction of the associative groups. Exploiting the more ordered microstructures afforded by block copolymer self-assembly increases the network stiffness by >100 times without significantly compromising extensibility. We use a high-temperature DIW printing platform to print these LAL polymers and manufacture complex, highly deformable 3D structures. Our printing process uses melt processing and is solvent-free, and the printed parts do not require any post-print processing. We create elastomers with Young’s moduli ranging from 8 kPa to 8 MPa while maintaining tensile breaking strain around 150%. Our elastomers represent the softest melt reprocessable materials for DIW printing. The developed LAL polymers synergize emerging homogeneous associative polymers with high fraction of reversible bonds and classical block copolymer self-assembly to form a dual-crosslinked network, providing a versatile platform for the modular design and development of soft, melt reprocessable elastomeric materials for practical applications.

105	3D-printed biocompatible hollow microneedle-based electrochemical sensor for wireless glucose monitoring	Chuchu Chen; Yonghao Fu; Yun Liu; Yuehe Lin; Dan Du; Kaiyan Qiu	Wearable electrochemical sensors have aroused tremendous attention due to their great potential for in situ and continuous assessment for glucose monitoring. Conventional fingerstick test is the easiest and most efficient method for glucose evaluation, but invasive and painful. Here we introduce a wearable and user-friendly microneedle-based electrochemical sensor, fabricated via resin 3D printing and integration of a single-atom nanozyme-modified electrode, offering excellent biocompatibility, high sensitivity and superior selectivity for glucose monitoring. This minimally invasive electrochemical sensor demonstrates the capability to extract artificial interstitial fluid using biocompatible hollow microneedles and a finger-activated pump, enabling continuous monitoring of dynamic glucose concentration changes. This electrochemical sensor exhibits remarkable sensitivity and exceptional selectivity, with a linear range of 0.1 μM to 50 mM and a limit of detection of 0.059 μM, attributed to the incorporation of single-atom nanozymes with peroxidase-like enzymatic activity. The glucose concentration data are wirelessly transmitted to a mobile app in real time, offering user-friendly access and facilitating remote monitoring. The described electrochemical sensor presents the possibilities for point-of-care health monitoring applications.

Conversely, while less intuitive, virtual models provide additional functionalities, such as retrieving molecular names and other properties. Currently, to the best of our knowledge, there is a gap between 3D molecular models and their digital counterparts. This paper introduces a computer vision model designed to bridge this gap by converting images of physical molecular models into their digital DeepSMILES representations. This conversion facilitates further information retrieval, enhancing educational utility. We developed synthetic and real datasets to train our model and evaluated its performance across various dataset combinations. Additionally, we attempted to improve the model's accuracy by multi-image input and beam search. We achieved 62.0% top-1 accuracy and 80.3% top-3 accuracy with beam search and multi-image input on our validation set. We also explored the model's characteristics, such as explainability by saliency maps, and examined its calibration. We also discussed the model's limitations and directions for future research.

108	3DDPDs: Describing protein dynamics for proteochemometric bioactivity prediction. A case for (mutant) G protein-coupled receptors	Marina Gorostiola González; Remco L. van den Broek; Thomas G.M. Braun; Magdalini Chatzopoulou; Willem Jespers; Adriaan P. IJzerman; Laura H. Heitman; Gerard J.P. van Westen	Proteochemometric (PCM) modelling is a powerful computational drug discovery tool used in bioactivity prediction of potential drug candidates relying on both chemical and protein information. In PCM features are computed to describe small molecules and proteins, which directly impact the quality of the predictive models. State-of-the-art protein descriptors, however, are calculated from the protein sequence and neglect the dynamic nature of proteins. This dynamic nature can be computationally simulated with molecular dynamics (MD). Here, novel 3D dynamic protein descriptors (3DDPDs) were designed to be applied in bioactivity prediction tasks with PCM models. As a test case publicly available G protein-coupled receptor (GPCR) MD data from GPCRmd was used. GPCRs are membrane-bound proteins, which are activated by hormones and neurotransmitters, and constitute an important target family for drug discovery. GPCRs exist in different conformational states that allow transmission of diverse signals and that can be modified by ligand interactions, among other factors. To translate the MD-encoded protein dynamics two types of 3DDPDs were considered: one-hot encoded residue-specific (rs) and embedding-like protein-specific (ps) 3DDPDs. The descriptors were developed by calculating distributions of trajectory coordinates and partial charges, applying dimensionality reduction, and subsequently condensing them into vectors per residue or protein, respectively. 3DDPDs were benchmarked on a number of PCM tasks against state-of-the-art non-dynamic protein descriptors. Our rs- and ps3DDPDs outperformed non-dynamic descriptors in regression tasks using a temporal split, and showed comparable performance with a random split and in all classification tasks. Combinations of non-dynamic descriptors with 3DDPDs did not result in increased performance. Finally, the power of 3DDPDs to capture dynamic fluctuations in mutant GPCRs was explored. The results presented here show the potential of including protein dynamic information on machine learning tasks, specifically bioactivity prediction, and open opportunities for applications in drug discovery, including oncology.

Yakimov; René Verel; Christophe Copéret	Determining the structure of Ga surface sites in Ga-based materials, used in catalysis, is critical for understanding their reactivity. However, obtaining molecular-level insights into their structure remains challenging. Here, using solid state Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) spectroscopy (71Ga, 31P and 15N), two different families of acid sites are identified in a gallosilicate material (Ga@SiO2), prepared via Surface Organometallic Chemistry and used as an efficient heterogeneous propane dehydrogenation catalyst or catalyst support. Through probe molecule studies using pyridine (Py) and triphenylphosphine oxide (TPPO), coupled with the synthesis of well-defined molecular analogs of surface sites and computational modelling on related cluster models using density functional theory, the 71Ga NMR signatures and the molecular structure of two types of sites, namely Brønsted acid sites and Lewis Acid sites, are identified. These tetra-coordinate sites can be described as Ga sites bound to three anionic siloxide surface ligands along with a silanol or a siloxane bridge, respectively, each associated with specific NMR parameters, which change markedly upon interaction with Py or TPPO, thereby enabling their structural characterization.

A modular 3D-printed device housing the ECM scaffold was also developed, readily fitting in well plates. HepaRG hepatocytes cultured on the scaffold exhibited enhanced metabolic activity compared to traditional 2D cultures, indicating improved hepatocyte functionality. Drug clearance studies with lidocaine, clozapine, and fluoxetine demonstrated significantly faster clearance rates on the scaffold, closely aligning with *in vivo* results from literature, while 2D cultures showed limited metabolic capacity. This model offers a physiologically relevant platform for hepatocyte studies. The findings underscore the model's potential to advance preclinical drug development by replicating liver-specific functions *in vitro*.

113	Bifunctional Catalyst for Enhanced Oxygen Evolution Reaction Activity	Unknown	The oxygen evolution reaction (OER) is a key process that enables the storage of renewable energies in the form of chemical fuels. Although numerous transition metal oxides have been explored as OER catalysts, the scaling relationship of the binding energies of various surface-bound intermediates imposes a limit on the maximum activity of these oxides. While previous computational studies have suggested bifunctional catalysts might be capable of overcoming this limit, stable and non-precious catalysts of this type remain elusive. Here, we describe a catalyst that exhibits activity significantly higher than current state-of-the-art catalysts that operate in alkaline solutions, including the benchmark nickel iron oxide. This new catalyst is both easy to prepare and stable for many hours. Operando X-ray absorption spectroscopic data reveal that the catalyst is made of nanoclusters of γ-FeOOH covalently linked to the edge sites of a γ-NiOOH support. According to density functional theory computations, this structure allows a reaction path involving iron as the oxygen evolving center and a nearby terrace O site on the γ-NiOOH support oxide as a hydrogen acceptor. This bifunctional mechanism circumvents the aforementioned maximum activity limit associated with the scaling relationship and leads to superior OER activity.

115	Factors Affecting Thermal Stability of Vegetable Oil	Sonia Randhawa; Tirtha Mukherjee	The thermal degradation of vegetable oils presents considerable challenges for the food processing sector and public health. This paper explores the complexities of the thermal degradation of vegetable oil, highlighting the interdependent interactions among its various factors. The heterogeneity in oil composition and external factors such as temperature, frying time, and frying cycles, adds to the difficulty in understanding the degradation process. Research efforts have focused on internal factors like fatty acid composition and antioxidants and external factors such as heating temperature and time.

Traditional methods for discovering new OOMs are inefficient and limited by chemical space exploration. We introduce O²-GEN, a novel framework leveraging a 3D pretraining backbone trained on a diverse dataset of over ten million molecules, enabling comprehensive exploration of chemical space. O²-GEN excels in generating fused-ring systems and conjugated fragment assemblies, achieving nearly 100% validity and novelty. It significantly outperforms existing models in speed and chemical structural validity, particularly for larger molecules. The framework supports both global and local generation modes, allowing for the creation of new molecules or modifications of existing structures. Additionally, O²-GEN integrates a property selector fine-tuned with density functional theory data, enabling precise multi-property screening. This framework offers a powerful tool for rational design and high-throughput screening of OOMs, with potential applications to drug discovery and energy materials.

117	Harness first principles thinking in problem-based learning for chemical education	Junjun Tan; Xinxin Xiao	In philosophy and science, a first principle is a basic proposition or assumption that cannot be deduced from any other proposition or assumption. Ancient Greek philosophy Aristotle defined the first principle as “the first basis from which a thing is known.” First principles thinking (or reasoning from first principles) is a way of thinking and problem-solving that breaks down a complex problem into its most basic assumptions, facts, concepts, or ideas and then reassembles them from the bottom-up. In this paper, we reported our attempts to harness first principles thinking into problem-based learning (PBL) in chemistry education. Two PBL projects were elaborately designed respectively for two student groups. By utilizing the inquiry-based technique and jigsaw technique, the understanding of the fundamental principles of chemistry was employed to guide the students’ research activity and strengthen the learning of chemistry. We also observed signs of increased creativity during the process. This communication indicated that first principles thinking could be harnessed to increase students’ learning depth and promote creativity in chemical education.

118	Hierarchical Chiral Luminescent Macrocyclic Porous Organic Polymer from Chiral π-Conjugated Macrocycles: Tunable Circularly Polarized Luminescence and Enantiomeric Fluorescent Sensing	Shiwei Fu; Yifan Li; Junhao Liang; Qi Wu; Lei Wang; Yi Liu	Chiral molecules and materials have attracted intense research interest owing to their inherent chiral structure and promising application. Precise synthetic methodologies, novel structures and functions are the core themes during the exploration of chiral materials. Herein, a precise and modular synthetic methodology toward chiral π-conjugated macrocycles (CCMs), combining BINOL moiety with axis chirality and tetraarylethene (TAE) chromophore with helical chirality, are established via intermolecular McMurry coupling. The helical conjugated skeleton within the cyclic skeleton is unambiguously confirmed by single crystal structure. Then, Yamamoto polymerization of the CCMs as monomers feasibly afford a pairs of hierarchical chiral porous organic polymers (POPs) with mirror-imaged chirality. These chiral macrocyclic molecules and chiral macrocyclic POPs all show bright emission as solid state owing to the aggregation-induced emission property of TAE units, and exhibit mirror-imaged circularly polarized luminescence (CPL) with asymmetric factor on the level of 10⁻³. Accommodation of Rhodamine B as guest molecules into chiral POPs has contributed to color-tunable CPL-active composites via chirality transfer and energy transfer from chiral porous frameworks to non-chiral guests. These chiral luminescent POPs are further utilized to detect explosive molecules via fluorescent quenching, and display enantio-selective sensing of chiral nitro-aromatics. These results have paved a promising platform for fabricating chiral porous materials with AIE function, and will further spur the applications in chiral luminescent POPs.

119	High-Throughput Solid Phase Extraction for Targeted and Non-Targeted Exposomics	Yunyun Gu; Max Lennart Feuerstein; Benedikt Warth	Characterizing the chemical exposome relies on advanced instrumentation including tandem mass spectrometry coupled to liquid chromatography (LC-MS/MS), and non-targeted analysis (NTA) using high-resolution MS. However, proper sample pretreatment, balancing broad analyte coverage, method robustness, and throughput remain a major bottleneck in exposomics. Here, we developed a robust and scalable solid phase extraction (SPE) protocol in 96-well format for human urine and plasma and optimized it for a panel of 94 highly diverse environmental and food-related contaminants (LogP -0.7 ~ 6.8). Extraction recoveries (RE) and signal suppression and enhancement (SSE) were determined using targeted LC-MS/MS. Acceptable REs (60% - 140%) were achieved for >70% of all analytes, and acceptable SSE values (60% -140%) for 86% and 90% in urine and plasma, respectively. Subsequently, the method was transferred to 96-well format, significantly improving throughput to meet the capacity requirements needed for exposome-wide association studies (ExWAS). The established workflow is approximately 10× faster than routinely used metabolomics-based protein precipitation approaches when comparing the estimated total analysis time for 1000 samples. The method’s applicability for NTA and suspect screening was tested and compared to a generic protein precipitation protocol using NIST standard reference materials for urine (SRM 3672) and plasma (SRM 1950). Favorable performance was shown for the protein precipitation workflow while the SPE protocol demonstrated promising results. The developed workflow is thus not only superior for future high-throughput targeted exposomics but also offers an option for NTA applications. The presented well-balanced approach is scalable and also applicable to research in the fields of pharmacology, food safety, or systems toxicology. Humans are consistently exposed to a myriad of chemicals during their daily lives through various sources, including dietary intake and environmental pollutants. Exposomics represents the comprehensive analysis of all environmental and food-related exposures and associated influences on various health outcomes. To allow a full assessment of the totality of chemical exposures in human samples, sensitive, specific, and robust analytical techniques, such as liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) are required. Multi-class or next-generation human biomonitoring (HBM) methods have recently been developed to monitor a wide range of environmental chemicals and are needed to address the full complexity of chemical exposure. In contrast, non-targeted analysis (NTA) is an emerging technique for exposomics using high-resolution mass spectrometry (HRMS) and allows the exploration of unknown chemicals in human samples. Furthermore, suspect screening methods use large chemical databases and spectral libraries to prioritize detected features and annotate compound identities. Both targeted and non-targeted exposomic methods face significant challenges related to complex biological sample matrices, and ensuring repeatability and consistency across large sample sets is mandatory, especially when dealing with low-abundance analytes (i.e., pg/mL levels or lower). Addressing these challenges in exposomics requires sophisticated optimization of the entire analytical workflow, including sample pretreatment protocols. Efficient sample pretreatment before instrumental analysis can reduce interferences, separate, and concentrate analytes in diverse matrices and various sample preparation techniques have been optimized to analyze the exposure. Liquid extraction (LE) and protein precipitation (PPT) are widely used extraction methods for exposomics due to their comparable wide chemical coverage. However, these techniques are prone to preserve matrix interferences which can hamper overall method performance due to limited sample clean-up. Recently, solid phase extraction (SPE) got more attention as an option for sample preparation in exposomics and is discussed as a promising approach for future large-scale applications, owing to its capability to reduce matrix effects (ME), enhance sensitivity, and improve consistency in high-throughput studies. SPE has been frequently used for the purification and extraction o	Analytical Chemistry; Chemical Engineering and Industrial Chemistry; Materials Science; Biological and Medicinal Chemistry; Energy; Materials Chemistry; Catalysis	https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2024-2gsrn-v3	CC BY 4.0

In this study, mer- and fac-Ir(pmi)3 were investigated as photocatalysts, showing high triplet energies and strong reducing capabilities, outperforming fac-Ir(ppy)3 in various transformations.

121	Highly Disordered Nanoporous Carbons for Enhanced Energy Storage in Supercapacitors	Xinyu Liu; Robert D. Hunter; Zhen Xu; El Hassane Lahrar; Céline Merlet; Clare P. Grey; Maria-Magdalena Titirici; Alexander C. Forse	There has been a lack of clear principles for designing nanoporous carbons with enhanced performance in supercapacitors due to their structural complexity. Our recent NMR and Raman spectroscopy studies of a series of commercial nanoporous carbons showed that carbons with smaller graphene-like domains have higher capacitance. In this study, we demonstrate that low-temperature synthesis provides a promising route for producing highly disordered nanoporous carbons with enhanced gravimetric and volumetric capacitance. NMR spectroscopy measurements provided unique insights by simultaneously probing local structural order and ion adsorption capacities, revealing that carbons with smaller graphene-like domain sizes and higher ion adsorption capacities generally have better capacitive performance. We finally show that the capacitance of a nanoporous carbon can be predicted directly from the NMR spectra of electrolyte-soaked electrodes. Our findings establish a versatile strategy that can be extended to various carbon precursors and synthesis routes, paving the way for the development of next-generation energy storage materials. Electrochemical double layer capacitors (EDLCs, a type of supercapacitor) are high-performance energy storage devices due to their fast charging rates and cycle stability. The electrode materials in commercial EDLCs are typically nanoporous carbons, which consist of disordered graphene-like domains that form the pore walls of a porous three-dimensional structure. While numerous efforts have been devoted to optimise the pore size, functional groups, surface area, and local structural graphitisation degree to improve the performance, clear design principles for optimising nanoporous carbons to enhance capacitance have yet to be established due to their complex structures. Nanoporous carbons in supercapacitors possess high Brunner-Emmett-Teller (BET) surface area and pore volume, normally achieved by activation. Among various activation methods, chemical activation using potassium hydroxide (KOH) is widely used in academic studies, as it allows the controlled and efficient development of microporosity at lower temperatures with higher yields compared to physical activation. The combination of hydrothermal pretreatment of biomass and chemical activation has also proven to be a promising route to synthesising high-performance nanoporous carbons for EDLCs. During the KOH activation process, KOH decomposes into K2CO3 around 400°C, which further breaks down into K2O and CO2 at temperatures above 700°C, leading to activated carbons with high BET surface areas and development of pores around 2 nm diameter. In our recent studies of 20 commercial microporous activated carbons, we showed that the degree of disorder, and specifically the sizes of the graphene-like domains, correlates with their capacitance in organic electrolyte. Carbons with smaller graphene-like domains were found to have larger capacitances. This was revealed through solid-state nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy experiments combined with mesoscopic simulations. In the NMR measurements, the sizes of the graphene-like domains were measured via the Δ δ values of adsorbed electrolyte ions in electrolyte-soaked carbon samples, where: Δ δ (ppm) = δin-pore - δneat electrolyte where δneat electrolyte is the chemical shift of the neat electrolyte and δin-pore is the chemical shift of the “in-pore” resonance, which arises from ions located within the nanopores of the carbon material. This Δ δ value observed in these samples originates predominantly from “ring current effects”, whereby	Energy; Materials Science; Nanoscience; Physical Chemistry	https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-4wvlj	CC BY 4.0
122	Comparing Microplastic Concentration in Recycled and Non-Recycled Toilet Paper under Controlled Laboratory Conditions	Evan Trinh; Dr. Kevin Trinh	This paper aims to compare the concentration of microplastics in recycled and non-recycled toilet paper when tested in a shredded state under controlled laboratory conditions. The goal is to determine whether recycled toilet paper contains fewer microplastics than non-recycled toilet paper. By investigating the microplastic content in recycled and non-recycled toilet paper, this investigation aims to shed light on an often-overlooked source of microplastic pollution. The results will not only enhance the understanding of the environmental impact of toilet paper products but also guide consumers and manufacturers towards more sustainable practices in reducing microplastics in everyday items.

123	How does the molar ratio between two anions affect the properties of surface active double salt ionic liquids (DSILs)?	Tomasz Rzemieniecki; Damian K. Kaczmarek; Witold Stachowiak; Katarzyna Marcinkowska; Michał Niemczak	The strategy of mixing ionic liquids enables the formation of double salt ionic liquids (DSILs)—liquid systems consisting of three or more ions with tailored, beneficial properties that are crucial for designing new active chemical ingredients. In this study, we utilized this approach to obtain new DSILs containing a common surface active cation with a hexadecyl substituent and two anions derived from commonly used synthetic auxin herbicides—4-chloro-2-methylphenoxyacetic acid (MCPA) and 3,6-dichloro-2-methoxybenzoic acid (dicamba)—at varying molar ratios. Nuclear magnetic resonance analysis revealed significant chemical shift changes (up to 0.256 ppm for the methylene group in MCPA anion) which were linearly or exponentially dependent on the molar ratio of the DSIL counterparts, indicating specific, competitive interactions between the ions. The performed studies of physicochemical properties, including density, refractive index, and phase transition temperatures in most cases indicated a linear dependence of these properties on the molar ratio of the DSIL counterparts. However, combining two surface-inactive anions unexpectedly enhanced surface activity of the analyzed systems. DSILs with molar ratios from 8:2 to 2:8 exhibited nearly 50 % lower critical micelle concentrations than their single-anion counterparts. This increase in surface activity was responsible for an almost twofold increase in the aquatic toxicity toward Chlorella vulgaris.

125	Impact of Fermentation Duration on the Nutritional, Anti-Nutritional, and Functional Characteristics of Colocasia Esculenta	Chikelu Oiyechukwu Elizabeth; Udeh Juliet Nnenna; Ugwu Vivian Chiamaka	This study investigated the effect of fermentation on the nutrient, anti-nutrient, and functional properties of cocoyam (Colocasia esculenta) flour at different time intervals. The tubers of Colocasia esculenta were processed and fermented at varying durations (24, 48, 72, and 96 hours), while an unfermented sample was retained as a control for comparative analysis. Subsequently, the fermented tubers were oven-dried at 65°C for 8 hours and milled into flour. Proximate composition, anti-nutritional factors and functional properties of the fermented and unfermented cocoyam flours were then evaluated. Results revealed an increase in Crude protein (15.11 to 19.81%) and carbohydrate levels (71.57 to 75.9%) with corresponding increase in fermentation time. While there was a reduction in moisture content (8.56 to 3.18%), crude fat (1.20 to 0.40%), fibre (0.73 to 0.21%) and ash content (2.87 to 0.49%) with corresponding increase in fermentation time. Anti-nutritional factors of fermented samples also reduced in a time-dependent manner. The result of the functional properties showed increase in water absorption capacity (0.27 to 0.87g/g), while a decrease was observed in bulk density (0.68 to 0.56g/ml), oil absorption capacity (3.47 to 1.04g/g), gelation temperature (85.35 to 83.92°C) and foaming capacity (15.54 to 9.52%). These changes suggest that fermentation can improve the nutritional quality and functionality of cocoyam flour, making it suitable for various food applications.

Kruchinin; Abolghasem Jouyban; Michael G. Kiselev	Accurate solubility prediction in supercritical carbon dioxide (scCO₂) is crucial for optimizing experimental design by eliminating unnecessary and costly trials at an early stage, thereby streamlining the workflow. A comprehensive solubility database containing 31,975 records has been compiled, providing a foundation for developing predictive models applicable to a diverse class of chemical compounds, with a particular focus on drug-like substances. In this study, we propose a domain-aware machine learning approach that incorporates thermodynamic properties governing phase transitions to solubility predictions in scCO₂. Predictive models were developed using the CatBoost algorithm and a graph-based architecture employing directed message passing to identify the most effective approach. Furthermore, auxiliary properties of the solute, including melting point, critical parameters, enthalpy of vaporization, and Gibbs free energy of solvation, were predicted as part of this work. The findings underscore the efficacy of incorporating domain-specific thermodynamic features to enhance the predictive accuracy of scCO₂ solubility modeling. The interpretation and the applicability domain assessment have confirmed the qualitative selection of the employed descriptors, demonstrating their ability to generalize to unique compounds that fall outside the defined domain.

127	In situ Methanation on Mars: A Process Concept Study on the Impact of H₂/CO₂ and Recycle Ratio	Franz Braun; Thomas-Oliver Nagel; Samuel Prinz; Jens Friedland; Robert Güttel	For planning return missions from Mars, considerations about the supply of rocket fuel are crucial. Since transportation of propellant from Earth and storage at Mars is costly and energy intensive, in situ resource utilization (ISRU) for methane production on Mars presents a promising solution. The major challenge is to identify a simple and robust production process, which provides the required purity of the propellant. In this study, we compare two different process concepts, with and without recycle, under realistic operating conditions using thermodynamic modelling and simulation. The H₂/CO₂ feed ratio is crucial to achieve sufficiently high methane selectivity and thereby reduce the effort in product gas cleaning and the overall process complexity. At the same time, recycling unreacted reactants reduces resource consumption, which is preferable for ISRU scenarios. Hence, our study provides a basis for more detailed process design using kinetic information on the involved process steps.

128	Pulsed Formation Strategy for Accelerated and Improved Battery Formation	Leon Merker; Markus Blessing; Bojing Zhang; Helge Sören Stein	Bespoke formation of Batteries offers improved lifetime and performance but is generally associated with long processing times, high cost, and large floorspace. Facile strategies like heating or increasing the formation current, as well as current alterations during formation have their limits in speed up and efficiency. We present pulsed formation on graphitic anode full cells as an accelerated formation strategy and investigate its influence on various quality parameters. Optimized pulsed charging is demonstrated herein to reduce the formation time by more than 50% whilst maintaining or improving all other cell quality parameters including discharge capacity. The newly discovered protocol is scaled up to 25Ah prismatic cells in the PHEV1 format that confirm the accelerated and improved pulsed formation strategy. We attribute the accelerated and improved formation to an apt balance of surface and bulk diffusion which results in thinner, more homogenous SEI. Dynamics of pulsed formation also allow for the extraction of new quality markers while formation is happening.

129	Integration of Micro-encapsulated Phase Change Materials into Thin Coatings for a Passive Battery Thermal Management System	Matthew J. Quarrell; Robert Batty; Alex R. Neale; Daniel H.S. Harvey; Dmitry Shchukin; Laurence J. Hardwick	Lithium-ion batteries are becoming increasingly important in everyday life with an increase in the number of electric vehicles on the road. This has led to safety and lifetime concerns, which has been linked to the temperature that cells reach during operation with an ideal operational temperature of 20-30 °C. Outside of this optimal range, damaging cell processes occur that lead to loss in performance. At low temperatures slow intercalation kinetics can lead to lithium plating at the negative electrode which could lead to the short circuiting of the cell. At higher temperatures, a whole host of degradation processes are accelerated, such as dissolution of transition metals, breakdown of the solid electrolyte interphase, and stored lithium leaching from the graphitic electrode. These effects can severely damage the cell, limiting the cycle life and, in extreme cases, lead to thermal runaway, uncontrollable overheating, and eventually potential explosion. During operation, especially during abuse conditions such as fast charge or discharge, Li-ion cells generate heat through ohmic resistances and polarization resulting in increased internal temperatures. There have been attempts to reduce the heat production of Li-ion cells, however these methods have an impact on cost and functionality of the cells. To prevent the temperature of the cell becoming an issue, battery packs in electric vehicles (EVs) are installed with a battery thermal management system (BTMS). BTMSs are divided into three categories: active, passive and hybrid. Active BTMS, the most common BTMS currently in use, pump either air or liquid around the battery pack to remove the heat from the cells. Passive BTMSs do not require any additional energy input to function making them of interest as an improvement on current active BTMS designs. Passive systems have been shown to be up to 23% more efficient than liquid based systems and 15% more efficient than air based cooling methods. A class of materials that has been considered for a passive BTMS are phase change materials (PCMs). Organic PCMs have the ability to store over 200 J·g-1 for example, octadecane can store 220 J·g-1, of latent heat during phase change which is stored and then released on the reverse phase change and as such has generate particular interest for BTMS. PCMs have been considered for BTMS for some time, however issues remain over integration. The low thermal conductivity of PCMs (for example paraffin wax has a thermal conductivity of 0.2 W·m-1·K-1) and issues surrounding leaking have so far prevented widespread uptake of organic PCMs into BTMS. To mitigate low thermal conductivity challenges, the introduction of thermally conductive additives including nanoparticles and graphene, has been explored. Additionally, to limit leakage and material loss composite PCM structures have been designed to hold the PCM in place during operation and impart properties on	Materials Science; Energy	https://doi.org/10.26434/chemrxiv-2025-djtpm	CC BY 4.0

Bäuerlein; Arjan Mol; Siddhant Kumar; Peyman Taheri	Ions are fundamental to solid-liquid-phase processes, whether as essential components or contaminants, making precise and real-time monitoring necessary. Electrochemical sensors have been identified as promising tools, particularly for field-deployable applications. However, conventional electrochemical sensing is inherently restricted to species that participate in redox reactions and are often single use, limiting its scope. In this study, electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) is presented as a promising alternative for ion detection, utilizing physico-chemical interactions at the electrode/electrolyte interface. A first-principles model was developed to describe the impedance behavior of electrochemical interfaces, demonstrating how ion-specific interfacial processes influence electrochemical response. Based on this framework, an extensive EIS dataset was compiled, and an AI-assisted model was trained to predict electrolyte composition with high accuracy, achieving detection limits in the parts-per-billion (ppb) range. The findings indicate that EIS has significant potential as a complementary method for ion sensing, providing a novel perspective on selectivity and sensitivity beyond traditional electrochemical approaches. It is anticipated that this work will serve as a foundation for more advanced models of impedance behavior and EIS interpretation, as well as for the development of next-generation impedance-based sensors with broader applicability in complex environments, including biological fluids and industrial liquids.

132	JOYCE3.0: A General Protocol for the Specific Parameterization of Accurate Intramolecular Quantum Mechanically Derived Force-Fields	Samuele Giannini; Pablo M. Martinez; Abderrahmane Semmeq; J. Pablo Galvez; Anna Piras; Alessandro Landi; Daniele Padula; J.G. Vilhena; Javier Cerezo; Giacomo Prampolini	While the intrinsically multi-scale nature of most advanced materials necessitates the use of cost-effective computational models based on classical physics, a reliable description of the structure and dynamics of their components often requires a quantum-mechanical treatment. In this work, we present JOYCE3.0, a software package for the parameterization of accurate, quantum-mechanically derived force-fields (QMD-FFs). Since its original release, the code has been extensively automated and expanded, with all novel implementations thoroughly discussed. To illustrate its general applicability, QMD-FFs are parameterized for seven benchmark cases, encompassing molecules with diverse structure and properties. These range from exotic stiff scaffolds, flexible polymeric chains, and polyenes of biological interest to transition-metal complexes. On the one hand, JOYCE3.0 FFs consistently outperform available general purpose descriptions, achieving excellent agreement with higher-level theoretical methods or available experimental validation data. On the other hand, the remarkable accuracy found in the description of the molecular structures extends to electronic excited states, enabling the integration of the JOYCE3.0 QMD-FFs into multi-level protocols aimed at reliably predicting selected properties and spectral lineshapes in advanced optoelectronic materials. The high quality of the results — spanning molecular structures, condensed-phase properties, and spectroscopic features — combined with the enhanced interface with popular quantum-mechanical codes and molecular dynamics engines, as well as its applicability to chemically diverse species, strongly suggests that JOYCE3.0 could play a pivotal role in the rational design of functionalized materials and heterogeneous systems.

Tietze; Masaya Sugihara; Lars Heinke; Rob Ameloot	Selective detection of specific volatile organic compounds (VOCs) is crucial for health, safety, and environmental applications, but current sensors suffer from poor selectivity and struggle to measure specific VOCs in the presence of interfering compounds and water vapor. To address this issue, we introduce the kinetic selectivity achievable in nanoporous crystals, specifically metal-organic frameworks (MOFs), into the domain of chemical sensors. In well-selected MOFs, similar molecules can have diffusivities that differ by orders of magnitude. Measuring these diffusivity values is challenging since conventional methods based on rapid changes in atmosphere composition cannot be used in a sensing context. A novel temperature-perturbation method was developed for thin-film capacitive sensors with a MOF dielectric layer to enable diffusivity measurements in a fixed atmosphere. Our approach enabled a single sensor to differentiate and quantify VOCs at ppm concentrations, even in mixtures containing high water vapor concentrations, outperforming a state-of-the-art ten-element sensor array.

Here, we describe new QASs of natural origin containing quinine-based cation and anions derived from proteinogenic amino acids – L-asparagine and L-alanine. The quinine-derived QASs were thoroughly characterized in terms of correctness of chemical structure, physicochemical properties, and biological activity. It was discovered that due to quinine activity, the new salts exhibit strong antifeedant activity toward stored products pests, and in the case of elongation of the alkyl substituent in the 1-alkylquininium cation, they also become potent disinfectants. The performed analyses also allowed to assess the environmental risk by determining toxicity to monocotyledonous (Sorghum bicolor) and dicotyledonous (Sinapis alba) terrestrial plants, freshwater algae (Chlorella vulgaris) and crustaceans (Daphnia magna) at various concentrations of the test substance. None of the QASs of natural origin showed phytotoxicity, and salts containing short alkyl substituents in quinine-based cations were noticeably less toxic to aquatic organisms than the other tested compounds. The results indicate that although a trade-off between antimicrobial activity and aquatic toxicity must be made when designing new quinine-based antiseptics, it is possible to obtain potent, naturally-derived and relatively low-toxic biopesticides based on quinine and amino acids.

136	Reaction Network of CO₂ Hydrogenation into C₁-₂ Oxygenates and Its BEP Relationships	Mikhail V. Polynski; Sergey M. Kozlov	Despite many efforts to steer CO₂ hydrogenation for the synthesis of valuable chemicals, its mechanistic intricacies remain poorly understood, complicating industrial applications. In this work, we apply a novel ansatz, allowing us to construct simplified catalytic reaction networks and account for the realistic active sites on transition metal nanoparticles to analyze CO₂ hydrogenation on Cu and Pd. Moreover, we present Brønsted-Evans-Polanyi relationships tailored to transition state characteristics, enabling further machine learning-driven exploration of CO₂ hydrogenation on transition metal-based catalysts and deepening our understanding of the underlying mechanism. By assessing the kinetic viability of various reaction pathways, we highlight the outstanding properties of Cu in the catalysis of various hydrogenation and C–C coupling steps in the CO₂ hydrogenation network. Our theoretical framework addresses the intrinsic complexities of CO₂ hydrogenation, advancing our understanding of its mechanism and guiding rational catalyst design studies.

Single crystal X-ray diffraction studies show a planar porphyrin moiety with an axial NCS coordinated to the Fe(III) centre. Electrochemical and spectroelectrochemical studies in solution depict clear changes in the system during oxidation and reduction processes. Mössbauer spectroscopic analysis at different temperatures also supported the observation of a high-spin state of the Fe(III)-porphyrin complex that was further backed by DFT calculations. Attempts to understand the origin of high magnetic anisotropy in the ground state as determined by DC magnetic measurements was undertaken by detailed CASSCF/QD-NEVPT2 calculations.

138	Recent advances in stimuli-responsive framework materials: understanding their response and searching for materials with targeted behavior	François-Xavier Coudert	Although all molecular assemblies show some degree of flexibility, the past decade has shown that there is a higher propensity among framework materials to display large-scale dynamic behavior. Beyond the seminal discoveries of the important flexibility of metal–organic frameworks (MOFs), covalent organic frameworks (COFs), hydrogen-bonded organic frameworks (HOFs) or supramolecular organic frameworks (SOFs), and many other framework materials, the field has progressed rapidly: the number of known flexible materials is ever growing, and the diversity of the types of manifestation of this flexibility appears endless. In addition, the microscopic mechanism of their behavior has been studied using a growing combination of experimental characterization techniques, in situ and in operando measurements, as well as computational simulation methods. In this Review, we present some of the significant advances in recent studies of stimuli-responsive framework materials. In particular, we highlight the novel responses that have been discovered in the past few years and the toolbox developed by researchers in the field to better understand the materials’ behavior (both experimentally and computationally). We also show some of the latest progress in the discovery of materials with targeted behavior, whether through de novo design or identification of known materials for new properties — similar to what is known in the field of drug discovery as repurposing.

141	Removal of Phenol derivatives from water systems with the use of silver nanoparticles	VARUN MALI	Phenolic compounds and their derivatives represent a significant concern within the realm of water pollution, due to their pronounced toxicity, environmental persistence, and extensive utilization across industrial sectors. These pollutants emanate from a multitude of sources, including petrochemical industries, pharmaceutical production, and the manufacture of pesticides, thereby posing considerable threats to both aquatic ecosystems and human health. Conventional water treatment methodologies, encompassing biological degradation, adsorption, and chemical oxidation, frequently fall short in achieving complete elimination of these contaminants or may inadvertently generate secondary pollutants, thereby underscoring the need for the formulation of alternative treatments that are more effective and sustainable. Silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) have been recognized as an innovative material for the remediation of phenol and its derivatives, because of their high surface area, remarkable catalytic efficacy, and pronounced adsorption properties. The distinctive characteristics of AgNPs facilitate the efficient degradation and transformation of phenolic compounds through mechanisms such as adsorption, photocatalysis, and catalytic degradation redox reactions. Furthermore, the functionalization of AgNPs with stabilizing agents enhances their stability, selectivity, and reusability, thereby rendering them as a viable option for water purification. This article critically reviews recent progress in AgNP-based purification of waterbodies by removing phenols. Notable findings indicate that AgNPs substantially augment the rates of phenol degradation, with variables such as nanoparticle size, surface modifications, and prevailing environmental conditions playing pivotal roles in their operational efficiency. Nevertheless, challenges pertaining to nanoparticle aggregation, potential environmental toxicity, and the feasibility of large-scale application require further exploration. Future research should prioritize eco-friendly synthesis or green synthesis methodologies, enhanced recovery techniques, and the mitigation of potential risks linked to nanoparticle discharge.

142	Repurposing Polymeric Waste from the Textile Industry for Sustainable Biodegradable Composites: Challenges and Opportunities	Nallarajah Jerusha Evangeline	The textile industry generates significant amounts of polymeric waste, primarily from synthetic fibers like polyester and nylon, which are non-biodegradable and contribute to environmental pollution. This review explores the potential of repurposing textile polymeric waste into sustainable biodegradable composites, offering a promising solution to reduce waste and address environmental concerns. Biodegradable composites, made by recycling textile waste, can replace conventional non-biodegradable materials in industries such as construction, automotive, and packaging. This paper discusses the various methods for repurposing polymeric waste, including mechanical, chemical, and biological recycling techniques. It also examines the challenges involved in converting textile waste into high-quality biodegradable composites, such as issues with material properties, processing difficulties, and cost-effectiveness. The review highlights the opportunities for integrating this waste into a circular economy, with a focus on environmental benefits, economic potential, and future research directions.

143	Revealing Two Distinct Molecular Binding Modes in Polyethyleneimine-DNA Polyplexes using Infrared Spectroscopy	Rusul Mustafa; Danielle Diorio; Madeline Harper; David Punihaole	In this study, we use infrared spectroscopy to investigate the molecular binding modes of DNA with linear and branched polyethyleneimine (LPEI and BPEI). PEI-based polymers are widely studied as non-viral gene delivery vectors, but their low transfection efficiency limits their clinical success. Our findings reveal that LPEI and BPEI exhibit two distinct molecular binding modes, which influence DNA condensation. Identifying these unique interactions provides critical insights into polymer complexation mechanisms to nucleic acids that can guide the rational design of more efficient and versatile PEI-based gene delivery systems.

144	RIGR: Resonance Invariant Graph Representation for Molecular Property Prediction	Akshat Shirish Zalte; Hao-Wei Pang; Anna Doner; William H. Green	Graph neural networks, which rely on Lewis structure representations, have emerged as a powerful tool for predicting molecular and reaction properties. However, a key limitation arises with molecules exhibiting resonance, where multiple valid Lewis structures represent the same species. This causes inconsistent predictions for the same molecule based on the chosen resonance form in common property prediction frameworks like Chemprop, which implements a directed message-passing neural network (D-MPNN) architecture on the input molecular graph. To address this issue of resonance variance, we introduce the Resonance Invariant Graph Representation (RIGR) of molecules that ensures, by construction, that all resonance structures are mapped to a single representation, eliminating the need to choose from or generate multiple resonance structures. Implemented with the D-MPNN architecture, RIGR is evaluated on a large dataset with resonance-exhibiting radicals and closed-shell molecules, comparing it against the Chemprop featurizer. Using 60% fewer features, RIGR demonstrates comparable or superior prediction performance. Alternative approaches, such as data augmentation with resonance forms, are assessed, and their limitations are explored. Available open-source as an optional featurization scheme in Chemprop, RIGR is benchmarked across a wide range of property prediction tasks, showcasing its potential as a general graph featurizer beyond resonance handling.

145	Rivers at Risk: A Comprehensive Review of Human-Induced Pollution and Its Seasonal Variation	Mitasha Kaushik; Manish Sharma	The worldwide deficiency of clean water is common for both developed and developing countries. Current time reports claims, Municipal solid waste from India estimated to contribute 10% waste leakage to world’s rivers till 2020, according to study. Future scenarios where population growth is high, but urbanization slow, India and China will face great leakage into rivers due to rural population close to water courses throughout 2025. A little over half of India’s 603 rivers were found to be polluted by the Central Pollution Control Board in 2022. This same issue stretches out to districts inside nations, like the Indian territory of Uttarakhand, known for its perfect climate however presently confronting extreme water quality issues. The proposed review utilizing multivariate factual procedures viewed that as 90% of water samples from Doon were contaminated. Rising populations, industrialization, and urbanization have expanded the interest for clean water, strengthening this emergency. This review study broke down river water quality in Uttarakhand across various seasons — summer, winter, and monsoon. The outcomes were contrasted with norms set by the Central Pollution Control Board (CPCB), Indian Standard Institute (ISI), and the World Health Organization (WHO). Various parameters like Total Dissolved Solids (TDS), Ammonia-N, Chloride, Sulfate, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Electrical Conductivity, Alkalinity, Total Hardness, temperature, E. coli, pH level, Dissolved Oxygen, and Turbidity were measured and analyzed. Study will demonstrate requirement for robust systems to safeguard water resources and protect public health, highlighting the critical need for coordinated global efforts to address the water crisis.

146	Rotated Fourier transform (RFT) enables the quantification of anisotropic structure in high-moisture plant-protein extrudates	Martijn I. Gobes; Sam A. Kuijpers; Camilla Terenzi; Ruud van der Sman; John P.M. van Duynhoven; Johannes Hohlbein	When producing plant-protein-based meat analogues via high moisture extrusion (HME), the structure of extrudates is determined by complex interactions between ingredient composition and processing conditions. To facilitate consumers in their transition towards a diet higher in plant-based proteins, the food industry aims to closely mimic the structure of meat of animal origin. Currently, insights into the structuring process are gained, for example, by imaging samples using MRI or confocal microscopy. Existing software for analysing these images, however, often lacks the ability to quantitatively analyse structure and anisotropy. Here, we present a new image processing method, named Rotated Fourier Transform (RFT), that enables the quantification of anisotropic structures of extrudates from multimodal images acquired at different length scales. RFT can provide a single measure of structural anisotropy, namely the weighted order parameter (WOP), for either the entire image or subregions thereof. RFT utilises Fourier transforms to obtain the dominant angles representing the structural orientation detected within the image. For each dominant angle, we further calculate an amplitude relative to the background within each sub-image. These amplitudes depend on the signal-to-noise levels of the corresponding angular features, which enables reducing the influence of insignificant features on the WOP. Here, we used RFT to quantify anisotropy in images of soy protein concentrate HME samples. We identified both anisotropic and isotropic regions and further showed that the relative spatial extent of the anisotropic region, perpendicular to the flow direction, increases along the cooling die. While applied in this paper to the specific case of soy HME samples, RFT is a generic method applicable to any image displaying anisotropic features. Thus, RFT is a powerful and robust tool for comprehensive quantification of food structures and beyond.

147	SEISMiQ: de novo impurity structure elucidation from tandem mass spectra boosts drug development	Emilio Dorigati; Jonathan Groß; Jonas Kühlborn; Robert Möckel; Frank Maier; Julian Keupp	Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is an essential analytical technique in the pharmaceutical industry, used particularly for elucidating the structure of unknown impurities in the synthesis of active pharmaceutical ingredients. However, the interpretation of mass spectra is challenging and time-consuming, requiring significant expertise. While recent computational tools aimed at automating this process have been developed, their accuracy in determining the chemical structure is limited. In this paper, we introduce a new method for elucidating unknown impurities from their MS/MS spectra. We are able to significantly improve elucidation accuracy by integrating domain experts’ knowledge, specifically the impurity sum formula and known substructure, into the model’s training and inference process. Further performance improvements can be achieved through transfer learning from simulated MS/MS spectra of impurities from an in-house database. Finally, the need for any experimental data collection for finetuning can be circumvented by simulating the entire drug substance synthesis process in silico via reaction templates.

As current procedures for data curation in chemistry rely almost exclusively on manual checking or peer reviewing, a (semi-)automatic procedure for the evaluation of data assigned to molecular structures is proposed and demonstrated. The information usually required for the identification of isolated compounds is used to clarify whether the data is complete with respect to the available data types and metadata, if it is consistent with the proposed structure and if it is plausible in comparison to simulated data. Spectra prediction and automatic signal comparison are applied to NMR evaluation, mass spectrometry data are evaluated by signal extraction, and machine learning is used for IR analysis. The proposed protocol shows how an integration of different tools for data analysis can help to overcome the challenges of the currently purely manual reviewing and curation efforts for data in synthetic chemistry.

149	Singlet to triplet conversion in molecular hydrogen and its role in parahydrogen induced polarization	Danil A. Markelov; Vitaly P. Kozinenko; Stephan Knecht; Alexey S. Kiryutin; Alexandra V. Yukovskaya; Konstantin L. Ivanov	An analysis is reported of singlet-triplet conversion in molecular hydrogen dissolved in solution together with organometallic complexes used in experiments with parahydrogen (the H₂ molecule in its nuclear singlet spin state). We demonstrate that this conversion, which gives rise to formation of orthohydrogen (the H₂ molecule in its nuclear triplet spin state), is a remarkably efficient process that strongly reduces the resulting NMR (nuclear magnetic resonance) signal enhancement, here of ¹⁵N nuclei polarized at high fields using suitable NMR pulse sequences. We make use of a simple improvement of traditional pulse sequences, utilizing a single pulse on the proton channel that gives rise to an additional strong increase of the signal. Furthermore, analysis of the enhancement as a function of the pulse length allows one to estimate the actual population of the spin states of H₂. We are also able to demonstrate that the spin conversion process in H₂ is strongly affected by the concentration of ¹⁵N nuclei. This observation allows us to explain the dependence of the ¹⁵N signal enhancement on the abundance of ¹⁵N isotopes.

150	Solvent Reorganization in Stabilized Protein-Polymer Conjugates Visualized by 2D IR and NMR Spectroscopy	Raiza Maia; Xiaobing Chen; Emma Mulry; Matthew T. Eddy; Carlos R. Baiz	PEGylation is essential for effective function of biologics, shielding them from rapid degradation and clearance in the complex environment of the human body. Despite its significance, a mechanistic understanding of PEGylation’s role in enhancing protein stability is incomplete, limiting the ability to design PEGylated proteins with predictable properties. Solvation, a well-known driving force in protein folding and stability, is hypothesized to play a central role in protein stabilization via PEGylation, but molecular mechanisms underlying solvent-driven stabilization are not well understood. Here, we investigated solvent dynamics and the interactions of solvent with the PEGylated carbohydrate recognition domain of human Galectin-3 (Gal3C) in aqueous solutions. Two-dimensional infrared (2D IR) spectroscopy, which captures subpicosecond molecular ensembles, revealed polymer-length dependent differences in protein dynamics and solvent dynamics for PEGylated Gal3C. Slower solvent dynamics correlated with increased conjugate thermal stability. Complementing these data, multi-dimensional NMR spectroscopy provided evidence that Gal3C conjugated to longer PEG forms a non-covalent interaction “shroud”, which correlated with changes in dynamics of the solvent and protein backbone. Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations supported an interpretation of the experimental results that PEGylation did not reduce the protein’s solvent accessible surface area. The integration of these data challenge the idea that PEGylation stabilizes conjugated proteins by dehydrating a protein’s surface. Instead, these data support a mechanism whereby PEGylation improves protein stability by stabilizing the protein’s solvation shell. These insights offer guidance for optimizing polymer length to achieve the desired thermal stability in biologics.

Bloch; Martin R. Johnston; Jeffrey R. Harmer; Christopher T. Gibson; Michael V. Perkins; Tom Hasell; Michelle L. Coote; Zhongfan Jia; Justin M. Chalker	Sulfur-sulfur bonds are ubiquitous across broad classes of natural products, peptides and proteins, drug molecules, and synthetic polymers and materials. The ability to make and break these bonds in a controlled manner is critical for their many scientific and technological applications. In this study, we report the discovery of a new and unusual S-S metathesis reaction of linear organic trisulfides. When exposed to certain polar aprotic solvents, trisulfides were found to undergo spontaneous metathesis, with equilibrium established in seconds in some cases. No exogenous reagents, heat, light, or other stimuli were required to provoke this reaction. Understanding the scope and mechanism of this reaction enabled diverse applications of this chemistry in dynamic combinatorial library synthesis, covalent modification of complex natural products, and S-S metathesis polymerization and depolymerization as a platform for chemically recyclable plastics.

Multi-stimuli responsive stepwise Spin Crossover (SCO) systems stand tall in this area. While the effects of external stimuli, particularly thermal variations and photoirradiation on the magneto-structural properties of SCO systems have been extensively studied, the area of pressure-modulated stepwise spin crossover and its associated magneto-structural changes remains lesser explored. Herein, we report a mononuclear iron(II) complex containing tetradeinate macrorcyclic ligand with β-diamine-based bidentate coligand, [Fe(L)(bik*)](BPh4)2 (1) (L = N,N'-di-iso-propyl-2,11-diaza[3,3](2,6)pyridinophane and bik* = bis(1-ethyl-1H-imidazol-2-yl)ketone) undergoing a reversible stepwise thermo-induced spin-state switching with the presence of three spin-states HS, LS, and an ordered HS-LS with the exciting re-entrant symmetry breaking during the spin-state switching process. The influence of external pressure on the structure and magnetic response is thoroughly studied, where the pressure-induced modification in the intermolecular interactions leads to enhanced cooperativity and a hysteretic stepwise spin state switching. The versatility of the systems is further explored where 1 displays a reversible ON/OFF photo-switching between a photo-induced paramagnetic metastable HS and diamagnetic LS states under light irradiations at low temperatures along with light-induced excited spin state trapping (LIESST).

155	Substituent effects of fluorinated bambusurils on their anion transport	Matúš Chvojka; Vladimir Šindelář; Hennie Valkenier	Anionophores are molecules that can transport ions across membranes. Several structural design criteria must be met for anionophores to be highly active. Fluorinated anionophores are usually more potent than their non-fluorinated analogues due to their higher lipophilicity and increased affinity for anions. Clear structure-activity relationships have been described for small and relatively simple anionophores. However, such studies are more challenging for large and macrocyclic anionophores, as their preparation is usually more complicated, limiting the number of compounds tested in anion transport studies. Here we present a series of twelve macrocyclic bambusuril anion transporters to investigate how variations in fluorinated substituents affect their transport properties. Measurements of Cl−/HCO3− antiport activities in liposomes revealed links between parameters such as lipophilicity or substituent polarity and transport activity. For some bambusurils, an unusually large effect of the presence of cholesterol in the membrane on transport activity was found. Further studies showed that for very potent anion receptors, such as the bambusurils described here, the binding selectivity towards anions becomes more important than the absolute binding affinity to anions when considering anion exchange across the membrane.

9	Weak Dewar bond modulates protonated azaindole photodynamics	Ritam Mansour; Saikat Mukherjee; Max Pinheiro Jr.; Jennifer A. Noble; Christophe Jouvet; Mario Barbatti	Recent experimental work revealed that the lifetime of the $S_3$ state of protonated 7-azaindole is about ten times slower than that of protonated 6-azaindole. We simulated the nonradiative decay pathways of these molecules using trajectory surface hopping dynamics after photoexcitation into $S_3$ to elucidate the reason for this difference. Both isomers mainly follow a common $\pi\pi^*$ relaxation pathway involving multiple state crossings while coming down from $S_3$ to $S_1$ in the subpicosecond time scale. However, the simulations reveal that the excited-state topographies are such that while the 6-isomer can easily access the region of nonadiabatic transitions, the internal conversion of the 7-isomer is delayed by a pre-Dewar bond formation with a boat conformation.

106	3D Printing of Layered Vanadium Disulfide for Zinc-ion Batteries	Stefano Tagliaferri; Nagaraju Goli; Maria Sokolikova; Rachael Quintin-Baxendale; Cecilia Mattevi	Aqueous zinc ion batteries are attractive energy storage devices for wearable electronics, owing to their safety and low cost. Among cathode materials, layered vanadium disulfide (VS$_2$) has demonstrated good charge storage capability, as a result of its metallic character and large interlayer spacing. However, VS$_2$ electrodes present fixed shapes and aspect ratios, and they are processed using toxic solvents, which hinders their integration in wearables. It is thus necessary to develop manufacturing methods that can meet the demand for shape customization and do not rely on toxic solvents. Here, we propose a flower-like VS$_2$ architectures using a simple hydrothermal process to formulate an ink for extrusion 3D Printing (Direct Ink Writing). The 3D printing technique enables the fabrication of VS$_2$ electrodes with porous micron-sized struts, high-mass loading of $\sim 45$ mg cm$^{-2}$ and good conductivity. Using the 3D printed VS$_2$ cathodes, zinc-ion microbatteries were assembled, achieving a capacity of $\sim 1.98$ mAh cm$^{-2}$ and demonstrating a capacity retention of over 55% after 150 cycles. The choice of the electrolyte and processing of the cathode ensured good stability against dissolution, a notorious challenge for VS$_2$ in aqueous environment. In particular, the dissolution of VS$_2$ cathodes for ZIBs was here prevented by the use of a water-in-salt electrolyte (WISE), enabling a long cycling life with higher capacity. This works paves the way towards form-free manufacturing of aqueous batteries which can be extended to different nanomaterials.
